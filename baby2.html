With the placenta securely implanted, the body is now accustomed to raging estogen and progesterone. The symptoms have subsided till they are forgotten. So the hardest thing during this time is choosing a name. A name that is not too common, not difficult to pronounce, not mind-boggling to spell and yet is still a name. If the daughter of Dad&#8217;s sister&#8217;s son has that name, it&#8217;s out. All your colleagues&#8217; names are to be avoided too. Surely we don&#8217;t want to be reminded of work everytime we call out to baby. Finally, if we have time to worry about names, that is a good sign.</div><div class="subline">Read the diaries from <a href="baby">First Trimester</a> or <a href="baby3">Third Trimester</a></div><div class="fleuron"></div></div><div class="group"><h2 id="second">2<sup>nd</sup> Trimester</h2><h3>* 30 July, Saturday (Week 12) - OSCAR</h3><div class="subline">GA: 12w +/- 4d.

It was the live broadcast of Joseph Schooling&#8217;s match: the 100m butterfly final of Rio 2016. From the time Joe sprung off the board, the whole clinic was cheering for him. He was ahead of the pack. At the turn, he pulled ahead further and was a body length ahead when he touched the end of the pool. The crowd went wild. It was over in 50.39 second. An Olympic Record for the a 100m butterfly and finally a gold medal for Singapore.

The past few days were not good. First, the yearly haze has returned. The PSI went above 200. That left us scrambling for N95 masks and air purifier. In the last two days, the news broke that the Zika virus was detected on our shores. Forty-one infected cases have been found so far. As the Zika virus is harmful to pregnant mother, we are finding ways and means to keep Mommy and baby safe. That means closing the door, not letting the mosquito in, doing the five-steps mozzie wipe out and dousing Mommy with insect repellant. We hope to tide through this difficult time safe and sound.</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>10 September, Saturday (Week 18) - Baby's Day Out</h3><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> Today is baby&#8217;s day out. It has been a while since we went on a date. We caught the movie &mdash; The Secret Life of Pets, at The Cathay. Then we had peanut butter and maple crepe, followed by shopping at Uniqlo flagship store. We had so much fun that we didn&#8217;t realise how quickly the time has past. Mommy cut her hair short yesterday as it is so tiring to dry her hair every night now. Every now and then, Mommy feels the tiny kicks from baby. Baby is growing stronger day by day. We have came up with a few names to choose from and in order of preference: Audrey, Vera, Stella, Mabel, and Charlotte.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="B31"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iANC22j6pUc/V9vjM3i3bOI/AAAAAAABZnI/aS_PjCg7Ccw9MjCt-DxGDSbEvs69QDMKACLcB/s800/P1070196.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OcYplExAXwk/V9vjMJjzxbI/AAAAAAABZnA/jo2NP8NAmik7uGP5JwCv31Z4w63Gw7tTACLcB/s800/P1070190.jpg"/><img class="_" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xZoKgodu-Ns/V9vop6JB_WI/AAAAAAABZoA/dxU6WgJNQiszjgdqzkmXztMIOb6wSK6egCLcB/s800/P1070194.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XS6PJf4d2Lo/V9vjNksQvqI/AAAAAAABZnQ/AiBqD4VgS14x8TZd32RcfjVf-KX3WLOIQCLcB/s500/P1070203.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vvzzvH4gExo/V9vjRRmz1EI/AAAAAAABZnw/sdDBvNAQ_scGztYo2_x_JdG-ui4nl9VqQCLcB/s500/P1070233.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dsCs2XavvZI/V9vjQRzMtGI/AAAAAAABZno/HLAhduWpx3k9M-hDzryhGIsZAyJbz523wCLcB/s500/P1070225.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3xzX6L4ZRSk/V9vjPUjjj-I/AAAAAAABZng/x5xq0ah5pbk70mpm865F32PCDQgeNmQkwCLcB/s1600/P1070217.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wam3lhtDrho/V9vjNLJ8WTI/AAAAAAABZnM/JiUZ-gQXuxgpl7f3gIpatKcnSoeWP21RgCLcB/s1600/P1070200.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ucFXLzRa9gE/V9vjODJi0NI/AAAAAAABZnU/Y7Y5PTsB-W8Eu7FDHdW8Z_VTmLeqCt0cgCLcB/s1600/P1070210.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l56ZOoB3d-M/V9vjOWAjw9I/AAAAAAABZnY/-vdU6mxcAXslTqTn2QZs4FXyI4PDCdg5ACLcB/s1600/P1070213.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jo-wWD0XUOM/V9vjOj6iVaI/AAAAAAABZnc/hnGBGWupEg0w2BOdbXlIyY7bMEgAvRaJgCLcB/s1600/P1070215.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7sfpN6pl9Hc/V9vjQKg8CMI/AAAAAAABZnk/ZzmN9rx1WbsSuXAIWKDIVt0ZQaGDGL_zACLcB/s1600/P1070222.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v1Ur0G6ZDBQ/V9vjQlClH-I/AAAAAAABZns/MB4XDPTxW2wr269jFFqFkStEQHGHGHplQCLcB/s1600/P1070227.jpg")--></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>17 September, Saturday (Week 19) - Pizzas</h3><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> Baby is kicking a lot these day. If I put my head against Mommy&#8217;s tummy, each kick feels liks a gentle flick. We get excited when baby does that. Mommy weighs 60 kg now. For three times a week after dinner, we will read to baby from books on general knowlege and bedtime stories. Most of the time, I am asleep after the story. On Saturday afternoon, we have English and Math lessons. Maybe it is because we forgot about today&#8217;s lesson that baby is kicking so much. For dinner, we made two different type of pizzas: chicken with capsicum and portobello mushroom with cheddar cheese. It was so yummy that Mommy ate two large slices. We are waiting eagerly to see baby via the ultrasound next Saturday.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="B3"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qos4MFcVLis/V-889oGxgxI/AAAAAAABaCM/rYoc2eBQzFIr8yMJUnPWIgIdxOYMrYGOQCLcB/s800/20160917_185105.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kl_8TAE1LHY/V-888XuG92I/AAAAAAABaCA/jY4uTy4-QDEDkIzOnuwIUi6IsfxwL58dwCLcB/s800/20160917_183127.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wOjMQ7E6BqE/V-8898M3ZaI/AAAAAAABaCQ/I8n-evP4kUwi5fMgIx14yMTZi2EE6WJLwCLcB/s800/20160917_185109.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EFfxS1HWFLg/V-889zxDEVI/AAAAAAABaCU/5vHv-tEbndUOFm5uXYHR6FjdEDevJy_UQCLcB/s500/20160917_185114.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eoFoIobnMOg/V-88-VosjZI/AAAAAAABaCY/N2V63OdCZyAnTZYocCn0iwUTDcUvfeW2QCLcB/s500/20160917_190816.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u2rQnOpY55k/V-89ATSnjjI/AAAAAAABaCc/YkW0BWAwy5Q-v4bThurGDAy_IRs4_WvdgCLcB/s500/20160917_191249.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dvHN1LUYZBU/V-888j40WeI/AAAAAAABaCI/KbATMkm7Qg4rpn6cKOU5CT1J3F5w-GeMwCLcB/s1600/20160917_183119.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jT6Fr9s0JTc/V-888Z2whQI/AAAAAAABaCE/o5igFYHIOXQU7ifmOlrlc4M-4AT2ivYsgCLcB/s1600/20160917_183928.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-txWUJiuuE5k/V-89Ab-UdZI/AAAAAAABaCg/_-apgfEiieknC_pqV_m2Iq0C5lXpAjaLQCLcB/s1600/20160917_190821.jpg")--></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>* 24 September, Saturday (Week 20) - Fetal Assessment Scan</h3><div class="subline">GA: 20 Weeks 4 Days.

There were the patient service center, delivery rooms, nursery room, and private rooms for resting after birth. Ellis and I were excited to see the babies in the nursery. Wrapped in a white bundle, only the head stuck out. After the tour, we rushed over to Suntec Convention for a talk titled <i>Smart Parents</i>. We learnt about the child&#8217;s brain development, how pregnant moms can continue to look beautiful after birth and understanding common symptoms of a new-born baby. Ellis says she is going to write out notes for that. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading them.</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>26 September, Monday (Week 20) - Five Months</h3><div class="subline">Mommy's weight: 61 Kg</div><div class="story"><div class="ellis"></div> I took urgent leave today as I just don&#8217;t have the energy.

I was advised not to force the poo out but to eat more yogurt and drink prune juice. Subsequently, the constipated feeling subsided.

Then, I proceeded to sing my favourite Chinese pop songs with passion. The amazing thing was I got multiple kicks from baby&#8252; I stopped and continued a while later &mdash; just to check if I was imagining things&hellip; Seriously, I am not! The kicks were as if Baby was running inside! Well, I strongly believe she likes chinese songs more. When I told Daddy about it, his view was that baby did not like Chinese songs and was &lsquo;objecting&rsquo; to it when I sang.

In the Dr Tseng&#8217;s office, he explained the fetal assessment and then measured the length between my groin and belly button. I guess he is measuring the uterus length to track the growth.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="12"><img class="_" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-safpRu-otwM/V_mhfSHdvlI/AAAAAAABaIg/ZR_d1w-C1v8RGNC1TXHu9bpa9uhuzyIdACLcB/s1600/Baby-20161008-2.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wZn44lILqRE/V_mhfdgs6GI/AAAAAAABaIk/XNHv26SCiV4gmDOE9HPgkV8urhGSOm_7ACLcB/s1600/Baby-20161008-1.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C1-mCEKauV4/V_mhfYg0MUI/AAAAAAABaIo/8wMpQvNN5hEIsIFsWh0yc_cf3cny4-aLQCLcB/s1600/Baby-20161008-3.jpg"/></div><div class="story">He then did a scan using a fetal doppler to listen to Baby&#8217;s heartbeat. Daddy and Mommy are never tired of listening to the rhythmic and strong heartbeat of baby. The heartbeat always bring a blissful smile to us. Next, he used the ultrasound scan and swiftly found Baby&#8217;s head, heart, stomach, arms and thigh. That is like more than half the time faster than the sonographer! My eyes and ears cannot keep track with his speed!</div><div class="story">After that, the gynae did a swap test on Mommy due to potential infection in her vagina which may be dangerous at this stage. It was painful to Mommy and the pain lasted about a day. Mommy had difficulty peeing and teared. All Mommy wants is for baby to be safe and sound. Baby, Mommy love you!</div><div class="story">Daddy has been working hard for the baby too! Besides earning money to support us, he also researched on the camera lens and gadgets and get himself ready for Baby&#8217;s photoshoot! Mommy, on the other hand, is in charge of getting the necessary props ready. We went to Spotlight to look for cloths that can be the backdrop for the photo. Eventually, we bought a pastel-printed cloth as one of Baby&#8217;s outfits!</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="2"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KLXsk2XBygY/V_nAVlWAFXI/AAAAAAABaKQ/iNRD8vKy17olHeo7ZpuWEXrklNFixjOMACLcB/s800/P1070252.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0RoB8bOHSXA/V_nAUblx-AI/AAAAAAABaKE/t956G6JLFb0qK0oGn0vFC4lzBW_hg93BgCLcB/s800/IMG_6113.jpg"/></div><div class="story">We also popped by our favourite money-spending shop &mdash; Uniqlo and got a set of newborn rompers for our baby! Our first little gift for baby! As Mommy feels tired more often nowadays, we wrapped up our shopping after a fulfilling lunch at Ichiban Sushi.</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>15 October, Saturday (Week 23) - Audrey</h3><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> Audrey. That&#8217;s the name we decided for Baby. It has a nice sweet ring to it and you get to curl your tongue over the &ldquo;dr&rdquo; part like "Auddrrey". It&#8217;s neither short nor a mouthful to call. Together with her surname, &ldquo;Audrey Chua&rdquo; sounds perfect. According to wikipedia, the name Audrey is a combination of the old English words: Noble and Strength. Well, I like that. More importantly, it is a name that both Mommy and I like.</div><div class="story">Mommy has caught the insomnia bug recently &mdash; it means she wakes up at 3 a.m. and cannot sleep again until 5 a.m. During this period, Audrey is mostly awake which she knows from the kicking. The next morning, it takes Mommy a long time to wake up. I have to nudge and convince her to trudge to the toilet to wash up. After that, it&#8217;s mostly fine. Now that I have a decent lens (24-105 mm), I am practicing to take good portraits of her in the morning. Mommy is looking beautiful in this dress. I expect the bulge of her tummy to increase quickly in the next few weeks.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1"><img class="_" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e3Kl50GQSbg/V_9eWysvdFI/AAAAAAABaLo/V4qPMDgJVCYW8i5QenGM_fav653-RggTQCLcB/s1600/Ellis%2BWeek%2B23.jpg"/></div><div class="story">On other news, I&#8217;m back to army camp this week and for the next two weeks. It means that I have to wake up early and miss the train ride with Mommy to work. Hang in there, babe!</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>16 October, Sunday (Week 24) - Baby Fair</h3><div class="story"><div class="ellis"></div> There was a baby fair going on at Singapore Expo and we thought we should start getting Baby&#8217;s stuff slowly before my tummy gets bigger. We had MacDonald&#8217;s breakfast in the morning before setting off to see what there were at the fair.</div><div class="story">As usual, there were alot of marketing personnel trying to sell their products such as Insurance and cord preservation. We combed through the fair wanted to get a mattress but there wasn&#8217;t any that fits the baby cot that my brother is giving us. We ended up looking at breastpumps and finding reviews online. Our shopping spree at the end of the day were breastpumps, milk bottle Steriliser and Warmer, and a special Warmer for breastmilk. Those stuff already kept our hands full. We had to call it a day.</div><div class="story">We then passed by the adjacent hall selling electronic appliances and we bought a food processor after Daddy watched the demonstration the day before, totally convinced of the amazing function! And finally, we took a cab home with hands so full that we couldn&#8217;t open the car boot!</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>20 October, Thursday (Week 24) - Walking about Raffles Place</h3><div class="story"><div class="ellis"></div> It is 24 weeks now, baby Audrey! Mommy is working hard and I know you are too! I took leave today to rest as I have been having my pregnancy insomnia. Occasionally, I also feel the round ligament pain. Nowadays, I don&#8217;t really know how to differentiate the pains. It just worries me when I feel weird around my tummy. Audrey be safe okie!</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cgy-lkOa8Bw/WAotBA7uQEI/AAAAAAABaOA/ecbRopKFTbYbiRiyd7I7MDfGw4uvODVKQCLcB/s1600/IMG_6472.jpg"/></div><div class="story">Daddy didn&#8217;t go for his reservice as he had a backache. When I woke up in the morning, Daddy is already busy removing the husks from the bowl of soaked green beans. Guess what? Daddy is going to make a husk pillow for Audrey from scratch. After soaking the beans for 2 days and using 3 hours of manpower, including grandparents help, Daddy sunned the husks for a day. It seems like the quantity of the husks shrunk after they dried. Daddy would most probably need to prepare another batch of beans for the husks. After this, he will be sewing the pillow case for you, Audrey!</div><div class="story">After lunch, Mommy and Daddy went to our lawyer&#8217;s office to hand the two cheques for the TOP notice of our house. Daddy is getting excited! Finally, long awaited house is coming soon. For me, I think I&#8217;m only excited about my dressing table and Audrey&#8217;s nursery!</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="12"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oOZ9w0whT_0/WAotBdJxZ0I/AAAAAAABaOI/etCMsBBrCl8pWy_5tF4nso2bJ59U5-VkACLcB/s1600/IMG_6496.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wIT38Jm7Xjc/WAotBVnXxAI/AAAAAAABaOE/RymNew9szzw3tRF8Zas6xMrZFPed0N1YQCLcB/s800/IMG_6485.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-26DU5SF9C3M/WAotDAFx1rI/AAAAAAABaOQ/KIHMXA85dk0AeA0nxR6KBofu8dpbPp4lQCLcB/s800/IMG_6538.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-od4avRdXapM/WAotC49ZXaI/AAAAAAABaOM/kGbpsmPI8agRxZNBq_L8LTE95dGBDDjpgCLcB/s1600/IMG_6511.jpg")--></div><div class="story">We then took a walk along Singapore River to Victoria Concert Hall. I saw the replanted giant raintrees. I sat there enjoying the breeze under the tree amidst the hot weather while Daddy went snapping photos. A short date for us on a weekday. The day just passed by so quickly.</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>22 October, Saturday (Week 24) - Mung Beans Husks and Pre-natal Class</h3><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> We are mung beans husk farmers this week. A batch of mung beans are soaked overnight and the excess water is drained in the morning. The swollen beans having absorbed all the water they can, begin sprouting and growing a long tail in two days. Now, it is time for us to harvest the husk. The green husk slipped out of the bean, revealing the pale yellow body. It looks like a mountain of wet moss after the harvest. After drying, it shrivels and becomes crispy. With all these dry husks, I intend to make a small pillow for Audrey. When the pillow is rested on the baby&#8217;s tummy, the weight provides a secure feeling. The husks are light and airy, allowing heat and sweat to dissipate. After today&#8217;s batch, we are one step closer to completing the pillow. What did we do with all that bean sprouts? I cooked them up with sesame oil and a dash of salt to create a yummy dish.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="31"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-msxxN7uw6p8/WAyAv1_sZTI/AAAAAAABaPQ/J11ey9HdG_ogXoValXVkNTbtDes1id36QCLcB/s500/IMG_6609.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PSsm3ayU3q8/WAyAv4jEmdI/AAAAAAABaPU/kENrsBQKO2YS-b0gx9zM6weaexNIulOCQCLcB/s500/IMG_6630.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fAqeyvEsNFQ/WAyAw13sTJI/AAAAAAABaPY/-n9c5tH2acYj-9FtOWZCyJm51AOn55llwCLcB/s500/IMG_6637.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N5teGMEUplc/WAyAvnq-LsI/AAAAAAABaPM/8nRnTBylR-ow_BawMpZmy8hL599NY9tWQCLcB/s1600/IMG_6617.jpg"/></div><div class="story">Today, we had pre-natal lesson with Doctor Wong Boh Boi at Ang Mo Kio eXplorerKid. Dr. Wong, she is mildly eccentric. During her class, she would go off-tangent with her anecdotes. Dabbling in a wide range of oriental mystic arts and western scientific pratices, she like the kung-fu master that descended from the snow-capped mountain after years of meditation.</div><div class="story"><div class="ellis"></div> Mommy has been feeling very grouchy. I easily cry over very minor things that I cannot even pinpoint. Daddy&#8217;s birthday is around the corner and the only thing Mommy did was to order a cake. Mommy has no energy to scout for a present and a good place for a meal. Hope Daddy can understand.</div><div class="story">I guess the pregnancy insomnia is really taking a toil on me, especially when I have to work on weekdays and I cannot take a nap anytime I want. I missed the lunch treat from your great aunt Karen. I just wanted to sleep in the whole day. Hope this insomnia will get away soon. The only pleasure I get is that I can feel Audrey&#8217;s kicks in the middle of the night when I am awake as if she is accompanying me through the long sleepless nights!</div><div class="story">Today, Mommy and Daddy attended our first lesson with Dr Wong Boh Boi at AMK Hub. Time flew quickly in the two and a half hours weekly class. She shared her knowledge on childbirth, simple pregnancy stretching exercises and breathing. Her father is a TCM physician and she was educated in western medicine. Hence, she busted a number of pregnancy and confinement myths. They were really convincing because she clarified how some myths were derived and passed down.</div><div class="story">After the class, we walked to Cheng San Market to collect Daddy&#8217;s Pulut Hitam Cake and to have our dinner. A long day ended with two slices of cake from Pine Garden as desserts. Tomorrow, we shall sing Happy Birthday Song to Daddy and cut the yummy birthday cake!</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>* 24 October, Monday (Week 24) - Daddy's Birthday</h3><div class="subline">GA: 24 Weeks.

Mommy&#8217;s weight: 63 Kg</div><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> Mommy went to the clinic today for a swab test and a scan. We suspect Gardnerella is back again. As I wasn&#8217;t there, I only get a second-hand account of what Mommy saw. Audrey gave a punch with her fist during the scan and it was caught on screen. I wished I was around to see it. I guess I have to settle with having my birthday printed on the ultrasound printouts (See Mommy, I have~ You don&#8217;t have~). And since, it is my birthday today, I get to make a real wish. I wish Audrey will come out a healthy baby. That would be the best gift for me. I noticed the Femur Length on the printout is at 52.99 mm which indicates a 28 weeks length. Either the measurement is off or Audrey is going to have really long legs. Maybe that explains all the strong kicks I have receiving from her recently.</div><div class="story"></div><div class="photoset" data-layout="21"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-71BHZnRtX90/WA8Udct6fRI/AAAAAAABaP0/--eoje5enqsLFI41_GIWx6aZdVXa4TubACLcB/s800/20161024-1.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Fq9SYodB9ZA/WA8UdXFqWLI/AAAAAAABaP4/a5e_DTlWXQwPjbROcHoZUpv_ds1OBxewACLcB/s800/20161024-2.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MClVep8XD7I/WA8UdSaKhQI/AAAAAAABaPw/i6EFdwt5J-gqcICZCykkVteJzqI4zGSoACLcB/s1600/20161024-3.jpg"/></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>30 October, Sunday (Week 25) - Huiting's Housewarming, Pain Relief and Labour Class</h3><div class="subline">Mommy's Weight: 63.8 Kg</div><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> Mommy&#8217;s tummy looks bigger recently. She didn&#8217;t take any waist measurement before so we can&#8217;t be sure if we had parent&#8217;s bias. Audrey likes to turn a lot. There&#8217;s plenty of space at the moment allowing her to squeeze to a corner of the womb. On the outside, Mommy gets a bulge on her side and it is hilarious to watch. I like sleeping on the edge of the bed too. Wonder if Audrey will do that next time?</div><div class="story">At Huiting&#8217;s housewarming party in the evening, there was great food, music and alcoholic drink. Mommy drinks only plain water. She has great taste, I tell you. Anyway, the sharp ones knows Mommy is pregnant after the group shot we took was posted on Facebook.</div><div class="story">Today&#8217;s pre-natal class (AMK eXplorerKid, 4 p.m.) was about pain relief and labour. There was a video on how the baby is delivered upon reaching full dilation. Nature amazes me. The baby inevitably goes into crowning position and pushes the head out face-down. Mommmy will do deep breathing during these contractions and push along with the baby. When the head is one-third, Mommy needs to stop pushing and start panting to slow down. If the baby comes out too quickly, it may tear the perineum. Once the head is out, the body turns sideways for one shoulder to be out following by the next shoulder. Now, the baby faces upwards and she is delivered.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="B"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S0mFPPhGmHs/WBV9-JV8O3I/AAAAAAABabc/JS9cxU2axtsTm2hPE7EXq_amnE0CfK3XwCLcB/s800/IMG_6729.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AF_kHo0YW0U/WBV9906IbuI/AAAAAAABabY/P9WVWqqlLKgSvMWlfMmGTOwgZKj79Fd7wCLcB/s800/20161029_120924.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZO5rkapRxoM/WBfOWAuL7fI/AAAAAAABab8/1zbMQp62_ZIGDDlS58YnvNr9tjt5ps4ywCLcB/s800/Huiting%2BHouse%2BWarming.jpg"/></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>2 November, Wednesday (Week 26)</h3><div class="subline">Mommy's weight: 64 Kg</div><div class="story">Feeding.

We finally got the key to Sea Horizon, our new house on Monday. The palpable excitement was in the air as the whole family including Mom and Dad marched towards the house. In the house, each of us was lost in our own world of checking out the kitchen, rooms, toilet and balcony. The balcony measured 8.5m in length was the highlight of the place. One can have a game of mini soccer there. Next, we have a good view of the forest, or what is remaining, beside our house. The apartment is on the 8<sup>th</sup> level which peeps over the canopy of the forest to reveal the a silver of the sea. I hope the forest remains there for a long time. For the remainder of the week, our time was spent measuring the length of walls, door, nooks and crevices. The size is according to the floor plan which we were gladful for. Then, the hunt for defects began in earnest.</div><div class="story">Practical Hands-on Baby Care.

Both Mummy and Daddy were busy with the new house that we had just gotten keys last week. We are both feeling ecstatic and looking forward to get the house ready for us and most importantly, for Audrey&#8217;s arrival&#8252;</div><div class="story">We had our practical hands-on session with Dr Wong on taking care of newborns. It was a fun session and Daddy was listening attentively and following instructions really carefully so that he will be about to take care of Audrey when she arrives. This class almost sums up the entire course. We are only left with one Doctor&#8217;s Talk at the end of the month.</div><div class="story">It should be 28 weeks now, counting down another 12 more weeks, baby! Please continue to grow well inside me. Mummy loves it when you punch, kick and somersault in my womb! It is an amazing feeling that I bet only mothers  would know. Sometimes Mummy wakes up in the middle of the night and gets frustrated for not able to fall back to sleep but Audrey will give me a few kicks to tell me she is with me. This makes me fall back to sleep with a big smile on my face.

It is the 28<sup>th</sup> weeks and it has been a while since we last saw an image of Audrey. This morning, I talk to Audrey, asking her not to be shy so that Dr Tseng can confirm the gender. She was really cooperative and we were very happy to see her in the ultrasound scan. Dr. Tseng confirmed it&#8217;s a girl by the &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; pattern. Good job, Audrey! It is time for some online shopping to get the props for your photoshoot. We were done with check-up by 9.30am. Our next visit will be on the 32<sup>nd</sup> week. Wow, Mommy can&#8217;t wait to &lsquo;see&rsquo; you again and count down to your arrival.

Her flips and turns stretches Mommy&#8217;s belly at different points. At times, her movements are rhythmic. Other times, it is consistent pulse at a spot and we are quite sure it&#8217;s not Mommy&#8217;s heartbeat. I took a video of Mommy&#8217;s tummy showing these movements which I call it "Flutters of Audrey". Occasionally, she gives a kick or a punch simply because it is fun for her to explore her new limbs. When Mommy sings, it becomes a rapid succession of kicks and punches. As for me, I like to lie on Mommy&#8217;s tummy every night and talk to Audrey. She may not understand our words right now but she can definitely feel our love.</div><div class="video" data="Sm4uRTf5V4g"></div><div class="fleuron"></div><div class="subline">Continue at <a href="baby3">Third Trimester</a></div></div>

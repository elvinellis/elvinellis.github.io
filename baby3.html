If the estimated due date is the bullseye of a dart board, then the actual delivery date is anywhere on the board. As early as thirty-seven weeks or as late as forty-one weeks. As if that variance is not nerve-wrecking enough, we have to second-guess fake contractions and doubting if Mommy just peed or has the water bag burst. Amidst the waiting, we are palpably excited as first-timers. We can hardly hold ourselves back from buying &ldquo;omg-it&#8217;s-so-cute-I-wanna-die&rdquo; clothes. As for Audrey, she is busy growing fat, kicking, pushing her tiny fists against womb and having hiccups.</div><div class="fleuron"></div><div class="subline">Read the diaries from <a href="baby">First Trimester</a> or <a href="baby2">Second Trimester</a></div></div><div class="group"><h2 id="third">3<sup>rd</sup> Trimester</h2><h3>30 November, Wednesday  (Week 30) - Doctor's Talk at SCGS</h3><div class="subline">Mommy's waist: 37.5", Mommy's weight: 65.3 Kg</div><div class="story">SCGS 7.30pm.</div><div class="story"><div class="elvin"></div> We are back at SCGS for a second time and the seats at their hall still kills my back. These seats are made for a younger and smaller body. At least the content of the talk is interesting. The head of CordLife laboratory is giving a presentation on the science behind cord blood and cord lining banking. He is a total geek through and through. After thirty minutes of scientific jargons, technical procedures, miracle stories, he ended his talk with a video and left the stage. Woa. The marketing department sent him here to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; the public and he took it literally. What a guy. But I&#8217;m sold on this cord banking technology based on its life-changing properties. It sounds like the elixir of life and I am betting my money on it. For science!</div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>3 December, Saturday (Week 31) - Audrey's Pillow</h3><div class="story"><div class="ellis"></div> We are counting down to the arrival of Audrey! The past few weeks were really hectic. Other than the many matters of the new house, Papa and Mummy were busy settling some of Audrey&#8217;s stuff. The insurance policy insuring Mummy during pregnancy and Audrey at birth has been submitted and is pending approval. We have also enrolled for the Cord Blood and Cord Lining Bank with Cord Life for 21 years after attending a talk.</div><div class="story">At the Baby Fair over the weekend, we bought Audrey&#8217;s diaper, some cute Mittens and Booties, Baby detergent and bottle cleanser and Mummy&#8217;s nursing bra.

He secretly lied on the mattress and exclaimed how comfortable it is. Naughty Daddy. Daddy also tested the breast pump by putting it on his flat chest and he was shocked by how painful it was! Mummy, on the other hand, was busy picking the beansprout husks. It was really time consuming and energy draining but it was satisfying to complete bowls of husks. Soon, Daddy will sew the pillow case and we can fill it with the husks. Please wait for the one and only one Audrey&#8217;s Husk Pillow made with love!</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1"><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3XZhe4aHvmo/WIQpK4PJbdI/AAAAAAABc6c/7XtIxT5BKskkYIDqvzvNRV3JOapS_VQDgCLcB/s1600/20161212_210455.jpg"/></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>* 10 December, Saturday (Week 32) - Baby Clothes</h3><div class="subline">GA: 31 Weeks.

These miniature and adorable clothes tugs at my heart string all the time. They are designed to lure parents into an impulsive frenzy to whip out their wallets and buy! So today, we came back with two more sets of clothes. I heard the stories of children outgrowing their clothes in matter of weeks but we can&#8217;t help ourselves.

I was definitely glad that we could fit all the things in our small and cozy room. There were plenty of clothes to wash. Both new and hand-me-downs. Grandmother (my mum) bought a cute set of clothes from Mother Care. Now that Audrey has so many clothes, Mommy and I went to buy drawers to store them. Mommy&#8217;s siblings shared to buy a Combi stroller for Audrey. Even before she arrives, Audrey has so many gifts already.

It is as if my whole belly shifted as she kicks. I have no choice but to stop my work and feel her. Sometimes I can feel that small little foot of hers sticking out from my belly. Some other times I can feel her punch so close to my groin that I though she is already coming out. It is truly amazing!</div><div class="video" data="9mE7fAAR3sE"></div><div class="story">Sometimes Daddy disturbs Audrey by placing his head so close to her and tickling her with his chin. And Daddy will get some reactions from her. These are the happy moments that make both Daddy and Mummy smile from ear to ear.</div><div class="story">It is the start of a new year. We were busy the past weekend attending gatherings with friends and families. Not sure when I will have the time to meet up with my friends so I think it is a good time to meet up during this festive season. Chinese new year is coming soon, in a month&#8217;s time!

First, we drew out the design on paper and then measured the pillow&#8217;s dimension. Next, Mommy measured 104cm x 22cm on the fabric. I double-checked the measurement and cut it out. As they say, measure twice, cut once. When the fabric is cut, the edges will unravel so I sew a hem. To get to the final shape, I folded the fabric in half with a flap at the opening. The hardest of sewing is the spatial visualisation of how to sew the fabric together inside out. After, both edges were sewn down, I flipped the fabric the right side out and tada, we have a pillow case.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="3"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3G_wime_F18/WIDX1SBqoOI/AAAAAAABc48/h4k8Nu0DLfUS_OJB_hFEcf6WygCV3ZFQwCLcB/s500/20170116_212353.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jxMEr1MqRZs/WIDX1hEhpTI/AAAAAAABc5A/uoPzFURu818wa_0TQkn0dyee_VlRibybACLcB/s500/20170116_212625.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0lDSvRulkVM/WIDX161i7SI/AAAAAAABc5E/Eid5YGdUvfEvt5DPbjG-blaYOJfXWbQNQCLcB/s500/20170116_213003.jpg")--><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KlRh5iHn8fo/WIDX2B6GX-I/AAAAAAABc5I/6UWD0xgDnGolIWQ3DMWAr6CzUQjqp9UUwCLcB/s500/20170116_213741.jpg"/></div><div class="story">After a quick steam iron to flatten the seams and corners, we put the pillow case on and congratulate ourselves on the nice work.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pMER0QSbgqU/WIDX2SRlz-I/AAAAAAABc5M/1pe99AtvLvER9x8hZkOr0xbViyQwTUCmQCLcB/s1600/20170116_214402.jpg"/></div><div class="fleuron"></div><h3>* 22 January, Sunday (Week 38) -</h3><div class="subline">GA: 38 Weeks.

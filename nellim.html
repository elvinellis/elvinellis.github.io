The van embarked on the hour-long journey to Nellim. It was an endless road flanked by trees and covered in snow. The cars were few and far apart on the drive. Under the snow blanket, there were no distinct landmarks to differentiate one area from the next. The arrival at the hotel was marked by a gentle deceleration and a large wooden board that read &ldquo;EraHotelli Nellim&rdquo; (Wilderness Hotel). The place is styled like a resort. The main building, located at the entrance, is where we gathered for our meals, beers and winter activities. Lodgings are in the log cabins and glass igloo in the vicinity.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="14"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nBAqZm7t2uE/V0HASnRx5PI/AAAAAAABVjQ/4het6UojwBwkculPPrlBymZlqWwqoSR8gCKgB/s1600/P1040903.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dCT6XJfLl-k/V0HARQ2I3XI/AAAAAAABVjQ/1zZME3iuGtYuTlY_m1wP4yN_MrjYG1v5gCKgB/s400/P1040885.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vje0Ku49R8w/V0HART2mQ3I/AAAAAAABVjQ/lm58yOaX0DIIc0OhdXbOJU9sj6TGeAi9ACKgB/s400/P1040897.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lTbcj0pridA/V0HARZAJVtI/AAAAAAABVjQ/Zsu1MZdvqdM_ldXh-kEiz7Uwv-7RofTxwCKgB/s400/P1040901.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-whH4ZHWKdps/V0HATIaTZFI/AAAAAAABVjM/KKXlyoAuICIChygD6Kj93PSLqPeLnSt0gCKgB/s400/P1040904.jpg"/></div><div class="story">Our accommodation for the first two night was in the log cabin. It had a loft, a bed above and below. The entire cabin was made from the trunks of the trees that grew here. There was a natural and warm feeling to the room as I ran my hands across the rough bark of the trees and breathed in the smell of amber.</div></div><div class="group"><h2>Husky ride across lake inari</h2><div class="story">The next morning, Ellis and I took a husky ride across Lake Inari. The lake was frozen solid in the thick of the winter. The huskies were eager for their morning run and were tugging hard on the sled. With six huskies to a sled each, we rode in a single file. Slowing the huskies down was primitive: stepping on a metal saw that digs into the ground. Earlier, a snowmobile has dragged a sled laden with weight across the lake. That sled compacts the snow while creating a track. The huskies were fast and the cold morning air bit our faces. Occasionally, a husky swiped its mouth across the snow at the side while running to quench its thirst.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="3"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4u_8s0VP4vY/V0G_JrT_wTI/AAAAAAABVik/brRWwm27Kvo11EdLaUI6o4fUfTfyOKu9wCLcB/s400/P1040919.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GbFqdk2efws/V0G_JZ2p4II/AAAAAAABVio/M0O55XVLpSwsOBhD9rXdxtaOD6oyi1s2wCLcB/s400/P1040931.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fOMtb9_6IzI/V0G_KSQI2LI/AAAAAAABVis/OuzO48c6XOs04WZ24qwnqFoAn7pMtDNCwCLcB/s400/P1040953.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3yU7tEZtluY/V0muiHH3jwI/AAAAAAABVug/L2ulclatyYgzHORTsVFBhrFTZdjAkW6bACLcB/s1600/P1050040.jpg")--></div><div class="video" data="0AKBKa8VPm0"></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Husky Dog Farm</h2><div class="story">Our husky ride ended where we first begin, at the husky dog farm. The huskies were given a drink and we were allowed to pat them. The Siberian huskies were truly beautiful creatures. Some had brown eyes while others had blue. They enjoy a good run. Although they are not the fastest runner, they can do long distances.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="122"><img class="_" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H-6-fdwDzuc/V0HCoRioQGI/AAAAAAABVj0/mVPI4OD1deMcLSB0vcockU7q7oAWjWAigCLcB/s1600/P2010690.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FO4XWTatXOQ/V0zGbl6HUZI/AAAAAAABVvM/pVu9seG73HUC8pRbjYhusqEULXyaSZoOACLcB/s400/P2010639.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XbRtFtVc12Y/V0L4STfKeZI/AAAAAAABVk4/80NEsn6O70I_wVkyot5GM3RcL-lbqIpIQCLcB/s400/P2010631.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WzTvHdQXZPc/V0HCm69bKkI/AAAAAAABVjw/ec4F_-vsbpkhdeNX4Nlh_keUycf6MrqGwCLcB/s400/P2010686.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EEckcPNJWdA/V0HCj4kpfUI/AAAAAAABVjg/59yZ2SrOOnwolFUNpcnffXPW9b0pOqILACLcB/s400/P1050091.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Let it snow</h2><div class="story">It snowed heavily for the first time since we came to Nellim. Feeling like kids encountering snow for the first time, we frolicked in the white rain. The snow tickles when it lands on your face and melts. The air in Nellim was dry. Together with the extreme cold, it creates powdery snow. If you fling a snowball, it burst into a mist of snow upon impact. It was hilarious to watch the other person jump up and down because the snow has gone into the clothes and tickles the body. Not so funny when it happens to yourself.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="21"><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HviYKNQh59k/V0jjnofcS0I/AAAAAAABVro/Hoa97gx3-8Yj47uanc8VDtnjRX3L94YRgCLcB/s400/P1050213.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-91_p73rc_u8/V0jjpOtHJwI/AAAAAAABVr0/0HKDb-XBIp4dJCxMGF1_b1z0u0r3yf1ewCLcB/s400/P1050228.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BWgVJ7csds8/V0jjnkM5OZI/AAAAAAABVrs/D-qHN2y4RWg6hY-N3Xj3tBNDXy00GMuXgCLcB/s1600/P1050225.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>A sky full of stars</h2><div class="story">The sky was pitch black at 6.30pm when we stepped out of the cabin for dinner. We looked up into the sky and scrambled back to get the cameras. With a clear night sky like this, dinner can wait. There is no light pollution here in the wild. Long photography exposure of 15 to 20 seconds gave shots after shots of the stars. The photos captured their brilliance, traces of auroras, and the milky way.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="13W"><img class="_" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7DRr-fV1uBo/V0W7lswtMuI/AAAAAAABVoI/mwgxlbmk_eAHUO9MHLG197HlqgWvaYZjACLcB/s1600/P1050148.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-94vh7DA_Vus/V0W7ptKjceI/AAAAAAABVog/d744ubd3PZc1e9a8IhdED3SATar40ITyACLcB/s400/P2010797.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W95DGhK3e_8/V0W7rvuXf5I/AAAAAAABVow/UzK6qhMEgQUEVuh4sZ5s6ROqHJD2QcpvACLcB/s400/P2020835.jpg" width="10"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kl71wz9PD4w/V0W7rOwSrHI/AAAAAAABVos/np7HOjMg6pUWUbv0ht-2G5P2A8nOp4wcACLcB/s400/P2010813.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J7cCK5MGE5U/V0W7l5upKBI/AAAAAAABVoM/o_V0hbS_1gwvylZSVXoQVbz5whQPYi9ggCLcB/s1600/P1050171-Pano.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>A walk in the woods</h2><div class="story">After breakfast, we gathered at the front of the hall for gentle snowshoeing. A snowshoe is small floatation device that you attach to your shoes, creating a large surface area, to assist in walking over thick snow. Your legs do not sink in as much with the snowshoes. Along with our guide, we went for a hike through the forest next to the hotel.</div><div class="story">The forest was hauntingly silent. The air was still and there was no signs of life. No chirping from the birds or rustling of the leaves. Whatever ambient sound that was generated, the snow absorbed it all. All you could hear was the ringing white noise in your ear canals and your breath. Looking around, everything was either white or black. Such was the bleak yet indescribable beauty of the winter.</div><div class="haiku">No sky,
no land:
just snow eternally falling &hellip;</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="3W"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wBAovJiBzlk/V0WdaWdDmyI/AAAAAAABVmY/dSj-_P7P2dU5gVgbL2d3DQHsK2KFHNu9ACLcB/s400/P1050286.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nsSKWbfuGgA/V0WdaTff5fI/AAAAAAABVmc/S4Kc3je0KlgXrA0bju4scx6vCGScBmEoQCLcB/s400/P1050291.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t0WT4IFLCW0/V0WdYysjC4I/AAAAAAABVmM/tNbJxRNedCImacnO5a6y_ZeL5qU2KXR8gCLcB/s400/P1050271.jpg"/></div><div class="photoset" data-layout="WW"><!--img._(src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SQgWkCpuEqE/V0WdYyUhNpI/AAAAAAABVmI/zvBWH07IhegNgDKn56ynTiD-tckor0HWACLcB/s1600/P1050261.jpg")--><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rPKXquTyinE/WGfP_2wHWvI/AAAAAAABcos/7FEhko8vXuQ_qSU6sKK7TPv4dETipaTYQCLcB/s1600/P1050261-2.jpg"/></div><div class="story">We rested beside a stream that never froze. Our guide brought paper cups for us to enjoy a drink. The water was refreshingly sweet on my taste buds. Perhaps I was thirsty. Along the way, we had seen footprints left in the snow by wildlife. Now, the guide drew in the snow the different type of marks left by a hare, vole, wolf, and reindeer.</div><div class="story">Coming out of the forest, we hiked across the lake in a single file. The snow was deep and it was easier to walk through the path that was compacted by the person in front. Still, each step required more effort than usual. The other end of the lake seemed so far away. Each of us was in our own world on this long silent journey. The crunching of snow under the feet, heavy breathing, and occasional gruntings was processed subliminally. We only snapped back to reality when the guide stopped for the dispersed line to catch up. After what seemed like forever, we made it back to the hotel. All I could think of lying down for a nap beside the warm radiator.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="2W"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CbJcQUy10SY/V0WiE13bZiI/AAAAAAABVm0/52p30C4zlQIOrq8jLWwpB7NZophEe6eQgCLcB/s400/P1050302.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RCtEM65CAQg/V0WiEq-PiEI/AAAAAAABVmw/KWiWHTSqohEAix3vIY7eShQI_diwXo9uwCLcB/s400/P1050316.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6ZCQ9U4e3zM/V0Wda1qOLlI/AAAAAAABVmg/5wCzdx5hGAYGvlVSTzaUuBaOs8Rj9TvcgCLcB/s1600/P1050312-Pano.jpg")--><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wKARfijxmLU/WGfT_1gLEII/AAAAAAABcpE/UJOw_OxRKTQJzFFx7AuGHB7t8vKctiGGgCLcB/s1600/P1050312-Pano-4.jpg"/></div><div class="video" data="xa4dd9-6Uco"></div></div><div class="group"><h2>The church down the road</h2><div class="story">Families in the hall were telling us about a beautiful church down the road. We asked for directions and set course for it. The thing about winter was every tree and roads looked the same. It was covered in snow over here and all white over there. One might pass out from the excitement of not finding his way back. We eventually found the church using modern-day wizardry: Google Offline map and GPS.</div><div class="story">The church was built entirely from logs. On the roof, the cross had two horizontal beams and a third slanted beam. A tombstone near the church had the same cross on it. I have not seen such design of a cross before. We couldn&#8217;t get into the church so we left not long after.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="21"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P7OSVbvpcSk/V0lAdaY1L6I/AAAAAAABVt0/vbUxSXt9uX8QOBFJBaLvFAm5mFIpo3KxgCLcB/s400/P2010753.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MUWsXFJ1IEI/V0lBd3TCZaI/AAAAAAABVuI/6vqEQ9E7snk6mxbcx999dZaxHphqpxJvwCLcB/s400/P2030085.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0hFaj0OEGww/V0jjpdSj1_I/AAAAAAABVr4/nQv7KBL6Ej41A4v1QKOCHAlknVkl5corwCLcB/s1600/P1050412.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Red House and Green Boat</h2><div class="story">On the way back, we cut through an opening of a wooded area and found ourselves at Lake Inari. I love this shot of the red shed and green boat taken by Ellis. The contrast of colors gets your attention and then you see the subjects are covered in snow. The composition is picturesque. In the  closeup of the boat, it appears to be a fishing boat.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="W1"><!--img._(src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g5ByWmjflFI/V0WdbO02AhI/AAAAAAABVmk/6-Cx85a54dEQe2pnxUcYr_6ZHv-_VmARwCLcB/s1600/P1050433.jpg")--><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kORvy1IKxyE/WGfSQcdV0jI/AAAAAAABco4/qh_A8zkoYyw5Npio4XPSCVJVCjis9epTgCLcB/s1600/P1050433-2.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-11VOz3bNYlk/V0WiL9BkgWI/AAAAAAABVnY/Sl5wxf4KTikG9ZZLc8HeCnDXbsabZI1TgCLcB/s1600/P2030119-Pano.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Girl in Floral Dress</h2><div class="story">Ellis had this idea of a girl standing in the snow where her dress will stand out from the white snow. We discussed about this back home and it was now time to execute our special project. She slipped into a floral dress that she had brought for this moment. I took many shots and liked this one best. There is a melancholy when you look at the back of a girl standing alone in the forest. Seemingly out of place, you wonder what led her to this place.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="W"><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SwLzu1YRxqw/V0WiLfW5AjI/AAAAAAABVnU/5CIOK_hNl-kcAAZVXEDZBYKe1uP5n4G4QCLcB/s1600/P2030195.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Paatsjoki River</h2><div class="story">Tonight&#8217;s activity was aurora hunting with two local guides. We got onto a van as snow started falling. Soon we were speeding down the dark road towards the border that Finland shared with Russia. We stopped next to the border checkpoint and the guide shared the history between the two countries.</div><div class="story">Next stop, we headed to the iconic bridge across the Paatsjoki river. Alas, the weather was not cooperative, there was no aurora. Making best of the situation, we took photos of the river. The Paatsjoki river flows out of Lake Inari into Russia is not frozen in the cold winter.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="W"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zunIcCaeOO0/V0WyiqPyfbI/AAAAAAABVnw/_4O0aCDNAtYQbSRCZtNK_Uj-NP1DxJDtACLcB/s1600/P2020032.jpg"/></div><div class="story">Our guides started a campfire by the river to keep warm while we waited around for the aurora. We traded stories and sipped on piping-hot lingonberries juice. After waiting for an hour, the snowfall became heavier and we went back to the hotel. Will we return home without ever seeing the aurora? We slept with a heavy heart in our toasty igloo.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="W"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ng0l0LSL-U8/V0WyiuK588I/AAAAAAABVns/Qa6WKrAZnzcu4DAftLjWQSgkY1_7KWlTQCLcB/s1600/P2020023.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>Aurora Borealis</h2><div class="story">My half-open sleepy eyes catch a glimpse of green light through a small crack in the snow-covered glass ceiling. Can it be an aurora? I stumble towards the edge of the window and peep through the crack. Yes, it is! I wake Ellis up immediately. It is 5.30 am and a flurry of activities happening in the glass igloo. We dress into our wooly bear suits, gather the cameras and dash out.</div><div class="story">You can read about it, watched them a hundred times on YouTube and the aurora still takes your breath away the first time you see. The lights dance. Oh, how it dances. Each ebb and flow gracefully executes across the sky. The stars are now a beautiful backdrop. The colors of the aurora are like florescent paints swirling through the cosmic medium. Staring awestruck at the sky, the aurora is perceptibly larger and closer. All these last for twenty minutes before the thick clouds rolled in.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1211"><img class="_" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fbRqgFgeS2g/V0jeeFZZclI/AAAAAAABVq4/iOYTp2E8ASECuGyuFrMLThiK7AmVnYRigCLcB/s1600/P2030038.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kLbunruzliw/V0jeiywYBEI/AAAAAAABVrY/4zCL-aXmUR4uk80Ek5a4QVaK5iNiQgregCLcB/s400/P2030051-Pano.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TmcFojnYALI/V0jefGY0PRI/AAAAAAABVrA/-wzwhUfMqIMfUY6-THnIEoMTZpGbNH0mgCLcB/s400/P2030041-Pano.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-80iJCcgTQFk/V0jec7-Y4dI/AAAAAAABVqs/4vKq2ZWfp7IGoGCTz-WxsPj3_V0bWaOKgCLcB/s400/P1050374.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sH9ZwSGKAdA/V0W7noDiQSI/AAAAAAABVoY/g7F8MTwStlMlFDrFfOerbf2_0bPLFospgCLcB/s1600/P1050192-Pano.jpg"/></div></div><div class="group"><h2>We will be back</h2><div class="story">This is the last day of our trip &mdash; from Ivalo Airport, we are flying to <a href="/finland">Helsinki</a> before heading back to Singapore.

We had to prepare our gears carefully for this 10-day trip. Firstly, it was the cold temperature. At minus 10 degrees celsius, you need the correct layers of clothes. Secondly, we wanted to take photos of the stars and auroras. To do this, we brought two wide-angle and large aperture lens (12mm f/2 and 14mm f/2.5) along with two tripods. I wasn&#8217;t sure if the cameras (Olympus E-M5 and Panasonic GF7) could withstand the extreme cold and moisture but they turned out fine. There was also a Dell tablet loaded with lightroom to review the photos. Both haversacks weighed 10 kg each.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LNItXtOqnBk/V0kNd2Ymk0I/AAAAAAABVso/Ec2PAzsAzD8bj68rwJ4eyuu7cRBwnHQfACLcB/s1000/IMG_1593.jpg"/></div><div class="story">Ellis planned for the Girl in the floral dress shot and brought floral dress on the trip. She shared her idea and I helped with the execution. We scouted around for a good scenery and set up the camera.

When a patch of snow has been stepped on, that patch compacts into ice and becomes very slippery. On this path, you can feel yourself sliding off as when the ground has a slight gradient. Normal shoe simply has no grip. I watched as Ellis slid away from me screaming &ldquo;Dear dear dear save me!&rdquo; I burst out laughing at the scene. We eventually found another way down. And yes, I did save my wife.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="2"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6qB3DS3fH2s/V1QzvzNs7LI/AAAAAAABV20/Fm-L9OXiqUg6Fu2mquRZYiWMOtpokcbSQCLcB/s800/P1290294.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8kb9uR-eHl4/V0k-hQuNNpI/AAAAAAABVtg/9BgBG0nzzdYU9udUvVB-ffdIsyxzbCfmgCLcB/s400/P1290299.jpg")--><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-px1Mo1942_k/V0k8fi7dd3I/AAAAAAABVtU/zGvAfSJd_kkPjBMHQUWAKVmQcmSiaQ6SACLcB/s800/P1040423.jpg"/></div></div>

Renowned for its clear seas and beautiful sky, we flew here to experience it for ourselves. The resort Centara Anda Dhevi located in Ao Nang and is a walking distance from the beach front. With two king-sized beds in the room, we get to roll around like kids. The view outside the balcony is an enticing pool with a bar for warm food and drinks which we treated ourselves to. It also has an excellent spa where the skilled masseurs did professional work on my muscles.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="32"><!--img(src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Amm0mBfLiyE/V8p3MS7WouI/AAAAAAABZAk/UOx9_oJMc0g0nma1tpvrejCv1ENpxG6FQCLcB/s1600/20131015_094348.jpg")--><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HMSjHivGBZg/V8p3lG36oXI/AAAAAAABZD0/cTEw_FmLSD8L5Z_qiGCIa_VJmoPyi6heACLcB/s500/20131019_084923.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LWuX0i1O5VY/V8p3k8vYsnI/AAAAAAABZDw/n7-YbMQfOtg4SxG4vqWvGORmfvYEnSA5wCLcB/s500/20131019_084830.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RtXBuPJx2w0/V8p3McJoinI/AAAAAAABZAg/agYGcR-QJTkWcSNH_EH1oB2Hta3zx06dwCLcB/s500/20131015_131220.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HYfZ9n5unA8/V8qipf7ovTI/AAAAAAABZEM/2Nly-PYrnx0TPbyc90J9iNqn9D5__ZKMACLcB/s800/20131015_134146.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U0kycNXD840/V8p3m7TSU9I/AAAAAAABZD8/Yp7VUgL_jNEBBNJCQYqkDWUxrhS13pjKgCLcB/s800/20131019_085700.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zmGL8eehB4k/V8p3MRKq1xI/AAAAAAABZAo/g66jNGNrwK4FfDCr1TN0aBMaRqNGUKzZgCLcB/s1600/20131015_125541.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NiQjdvrUo5c/V8p3NqR4Z_I/AAAAAAABZAs/vm6ZbWf_fvwyeA5L5257PIQjLIdTxzlLgCLcB/s1600/20131015_134132.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NkvymH9XDms/V8p3mqgVNUI/AAAAAAABZD4/ytigY3O1M9w9R_IV7_fORLR_Uo8haGjfwCLcB/s1600/20131019_085630.jpg")--></div><div class="story">For lunch, we had pineapple rice and mango salad. These are two popular Thai dishes. I especially enjoy pineapple rice as it comes with raisin and cashew nuts too. It packs a flavourful punch.

There are more locals here than tourists and the hawkes sell the local food and produce. The stalls are makeshift and I believe we were standing on what is supposed to be a parking ground in the day. We bought their local snacks to try and they are not bad. The atmosphere reminds me of the Pasar Malam we have in Singapore. After a tour of the market, we headed back to the resort. For dinner, we had home-cooked food at a restaurant near our resort.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="1232"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7VYmyyBwbFg/V8p3ZOqz4DI/AAAAAAABZBw/fEH9oO4Hd3opyii6EMjFCYruHLMUJO_YwCLcB/s1600/20131016_184845.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qL3ZtHRhu9M/V8p3ZMdAi0I/AAAAAAABZB0/z9IlBr4ONH8v9VyEU-OPX-vYPZJWGrOGQCLcB/s800/20131016_184851.jpg"/><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LQhNdwULxpo/V8p3ZphkjuI/AAAAAAABZB4/HSDaHX-ay1YcmMwwb-CEBQYlJghKa4ZLACLcB/s800/20131016_184937.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-49qgn101hHs/V8p3aBdSzpI/AAAAAAABZB8/Ig_s89Plq5Y7gH5aQgbRF9j270oihzsmgCLcB/s500/20131016_185006.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pLgygzUG94s/V8p3aaLebbI/AAAAAAABZCA/2YuKbiqN2ooxSc3M47mzbxtfLjA5CcG1QCLcB/s500/20131016_195607.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rADSjFYJ6JI/V8p3arVHbiI/AAAAAAABZCE/QxidyTB3514frJzpJURejoovyqLWzXlswCLcB/s500/20131016_195625.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ypEBQwiqhm4/V8p3blksoeI/AAAAAAABZCI/NrTB27ZrAOA18mDO3ZEzq6ghFtdsYW9cACLcB/s800/20131016_202432.jpg"/><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KeyC_va-G4k/V8p3bg_ItqI/AAAAAAABZCM/kZ2r_vpNtfAPoVeJ5UQeXro5hVVhyJhJACLcB/s800/20131016_202453.jpg"/></div><h2>Kayaking at Bor Thor</h2><div class="story">The day begins with an hour drive from our resort to a swampy river in the north. We set off excitedly on our kayak with two other groups: a Russian couple and an English lady. After learning the basics of kayaking, we ventured downstream and banked left into the swamp. That&#8217;s when the mosquito attacked me and Ellis. There were so many of them, on my limbs, body, and neck. Smack, whack, and slap! I must have killed around twenty of them. Then, there were roots jutting out of the water and low branches hanging over. With our miserable kayaking, we were crashing into roots and have leaves and branches smack our heads. Finally, we got to rest when we docked to visit limestone caves. Look at our worn-out faces.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="213"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lXJ5sdKb5og/UmaWLLH6vHI/AAAAAAAANMs/TaAnx6-pJks/s800/Krabi_Bor_Thor.PNG"/><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nGXJMsXZ4gI/Umac4SkFNSI/AAAAAAAANM4/pZevDa2aCDw/s800/Krabi_Bor_Thor_Route.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uBf0qMtS7YI/V8p3b8dBQ0I/AAAAAAABZCQ/zT5nmU7i9K82cessnv0AOb4H4pgSX15wgCLcB/s1600/20131017_120141.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PGH8ZiCCc24/V8p3c3I9ljI/AAAAAAABZCU/vvHrdgvBh-cfSaaJbTBVf6eLTRlXy-wIgCLcB/s500/20131017_120155.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MRjZk-8Bt1M/V8p3c2ryzsI/AAAAAAABZCY/LyiMET-4EokF-VziBMAPgKNDM4I2qMeIwCLcB/s500/20131017_120204.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HQB606tLO3s/V8p3dOCpDKI/AAAAAAABZCc/Q5HdwaKtWnsuHMQxfE5xrKCxwVrMLYMsgCLcB/s500/20131017_120217.jpg"/></div><div class="story">As we made our way back, it began to drizzle. When we got out of the swamp, the drizzle became rain. To get back, we had to paddle upstream. With the rain pouring, all the water is in a hurry to flow down the river. It was taking a monstrous effort to paddle back. Our limbs were tired and aching, our body was cold and damp from the rain and the river was fighting us. At some point, we appeared to be at the same spot even when we were paddling furiously. I cannot imagine how fast we will be swept off if we stopped. The Russian couple was ahead of us and the English lady was a good fifty meters behind. We were suddenly struck with fear that we may not make it back.</div><div class="story">It must be the adrenaline of the near-death thought that got me paddling like crazy. Inch by inch, meter by meter, we clawed our kayak up the river to the shore. I was so relieved that we made it. When I looked back, the English lady was 100 meters and screaming help! Our guide was nonchalant about the situation and even joked with his mate about it. I had to convince him to save her. Finally, he grumbled and got back down to his kayak, paddled to the lady and lashed his kayak to hers with a rope. Then he single-handedly pulled her kayak back to shore. When we relived the horror later, the lady was disappointed with the guide and thanked me for looking out for her. She said she was so tired that she didn&#8217;t know if she could make it back at all. I was just glad all of us made it back alive.</div></div><div class="group"><h2>Ao Nang Beach</h2><div class="story">Ao Nang beach is a quiet place. It doesn&#8217;t have wild waves for surfing so it looks boringly normal.Well, that gives me some courage to write &ldquo;I &hearts; Ellis&rdquo; in the sand which Ellis tagged a &ldquo;&hearts; Elvin&rdquo; behind. Well, at least those were good sand for writing mushy declarations on.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="13"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XCR7adw1Wrw/V8p3fcYJ08I/AAAAAAABZC4/JR1AbYenEkImU2Zm0IAzbHhpy_NdPACtgCLcB/s1600/20131018_120110.jpg"/><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KOiEToV8dYE/V8p3TK5I38I/AAAAAAABZBE/40NlU1FJwNoiNqQ1FE8Hm54O6x99CejWwCLcB/s500/20131015_150643.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1SdegSyY-qI/V8p3Uig70WI/AAAAAAABZBI/9GnQrF8WQHMZKM__uO-C7LIy4SsHeH5uwCLcB/s500/20131015_150748.jpg"/><img class="_" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fYqEpaxJU-k/V8p3edTNC-I/AAAAAAABZCs/bFm1dhuHX4wUKeLPZAy7g2dZXLS7NTkOQCLcB/s500/20131018_105027.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nEQSk-7iTUM/V8p3eOgHG2I/AAAAAAABZCo/sD88l4gbY_Mql7LALsWeo38Mf2uk5fb3ACLcB/s1600/20131018_104835.jpg")--></div><div class="video cont" data="sqMBY_ER-xQ"></div><div class="story">The sun sets in front of the beach. Within an hour, the beach has transformed from normal to spectacular. There are no obstructions or unsightly ships. We sat there and watched the sun changed its hue and color every minute.

We hired a minivan and set off to Krabi Town. This is the city center of Krabi and it is more urbanized. There are plenty of stores	set up along the roads beside the shop houses. The road lead to a wide open center area where the residents gathered to eat. It likely evolved from the village center in the past. Ellis bought little gifts for her family and friends.</div><div class="photoset" data-layout="13"><img class="_" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RWNRmO56pRU/V8p3jyIZZRI/AAAAAAABZDg/-XHVpGJhO08P4zZw1dFECm1bghtdEUEowCLcB/s1600/20131018_194112.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u3b9zoQzzXs/V8p3jcac_yI/AAAAAAABZDc/Jf2_rF0pEPMM8UmgUyEUjI2ytQSfABChwCLcB/s500/20131018_194016.jpg"/><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YkG1TSlgGYM/V8p3kMZFk9I/AAAAAAABZDk/zqnul3AfC6s5H2t_QEdQbUS7UIHe8RyxACLcB/s500/20131018_194121.jpg"/><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vTEKzK8eOeU/V8p3kuSCJII/AAAAAAABZDs/JyOMVmKDwbYlIT7dbdtBU9WF1ehqHpKCQCLcB/s500/20131018_210625.jpg"/><!--img(src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v4Hw41OpxPM/V8p3jJgLpVI/AAAAAAABZDY/6vsYHpsO5NoTATyyYT-SZ83MeIeW93HswCLcB/s1600/20131018_194012.jpg")--><!--img(src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WMRV9BHgdi0/V8p3kHAzw6I/AAAAAAABZDo/Xxhet-2_bTQSX4CWq6la7RB4cb9gSkFVACLcB/s1600/20131018_194127.jpg")--></div><div class="story">The days past quickly here.</div></div>

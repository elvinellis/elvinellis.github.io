	h2 Porvoo - The Old Medieval Town
	.story We took a coach out of Helsinki city to Porvoo, one of the six Medieval towns of Finland, just an hour away from city centre. It was as if we had time travelled. They have the famous red shore houses that created a unique backdrop for the Porvoo river - Porvoonjoki.

	.story We noticed that newer and modern-looking  shore houses were filling up on the other side of the riverbank. There was also a row of red residential houses.  It was quite a refreshing look.

	h2 Old Porvoo Walk
	.story We took a walk along their heritage trail with the map we had gotten from the tourist's centre. Walking along the trail feels like walking in a fairy tale scene. We passed by their Town Hall and Porvoo Cathedral. Every house along the street varies from 2 to 3 storeys with hip roofs and they are donned in different pastel colours - green, yellow, red, blue, pink... you name it, they have it. That was colouring book brought to life!

	h2 Runeburg
	.story Porvoo is famous also because it is the home of Johan Ludwig Runeburg - Finland National Poet. They even have a tart named after him - Runeburg Tart. We went to Cabriole Restaurant that served buffet for our lunch. We had the sweet Runeburg Tart there as well. The texture of the tart is similar to a financier with strawberry jam in it. Elvin also surprised me with their famous macarons although I know he doesn't like sweet stuff - That's sweet.

	.story It was not a long walk but we were feeling rather tired, probably because we were not used to the little slopes around and the icy pavement. However, we were glad that we completed it. We walked back to the bus terminal and took a bus back to Helsinki. I was worried for a moment because the route back seemed longer and different from the one in the morning. It turned out that there were a couple of buses that terminate at Kamppi Bus Station. Phew, so sit back and enjoy the ride!

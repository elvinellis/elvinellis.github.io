	h2 Hard Rock Bali
	.story Upon arriving at the Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport, we spotted the iconic black Hard Rock guitar sign. It stood out among a hundred white placards with names on it. Between the twenty-minutes ride to hotel, we laid eyes on blue waters of Kuta Beach. Upon check-in, Ellis went gaga over the decoration of flowers and chocolates. This was the "Naughty and Nice" package because it sounded kinky. They have other packages like Rock The House for families and Retune if you are into spa. The room decor was modern with a splash of bright colors. The Hard Rock logo was everywhere, even the disposable bedroom slippers. If they had it their way, they probably stamp the logo on every guest's forehead too.

	.story The Hard Rock television has the best design and features that I have explored to date. My favourite was the Free Movies features. This wasn't some HBO or Star Movie broadcast. It was on-demand streaming of blockbusters movies. As I scrolled over each movies, the trailer played on its own. Movies streamed immediately - no buffering and waiting. Over the next few nights, I watched The Armstrong Lie, Frozen, Dolphin Tale 2, The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Heat (this movie is real funny by the way).

	.story The best feature in Hard Rock Bali was the artificial beach in the main swimming pool. Imagine a very large pool with soft fine sand forming an island in the middle. The experience of stepping on sand while dipping in clear pool water is surreal. There were no waves and cold salty water. On the sand island, there were deck chairs to laze around. Pool towels were available from the desk nearby. You can loan large inflatable floats that seats one or two person. There were daily activities at the Sand Island for the kids to take part and have a smashing great time. After much fun in the water, Ellis and I hit the pool-side bar for Caprioska.

	h2 Street
	.story After surfing, we went for a stroll around the Kuta town. Not long after, we found ourselves in a shopping mall that looks like it came out of the same assembly line of the malls in Singapore called the Beach Walk Shopping Centres. It had all the popular major brands. At that moment, we were more interested in food and spotted Johnny Rockets. It was colorful and it served hamburgers. Our stomach made the decision and we went in for lunch. The burgers were good - lots of cheese, a thick slab of beef patty, fries and soda. All these for a weekday promotional price of SGD $10. After a heavy lunch, we went for a stroll. There were many small streets around lined with shops, hotels, restaurants, houses and temples. The shops sold craft items.

	h2 Candlelight Dinner
	.story On the second night in Bali, we had a special romantic dinner in the hotel. The dinner was part of the Naughty and Nice package. Prior to checking in, the manager of the Splash Bistro emailed me to confirm the date and time. I was guessing it will be a red table cloth with candlelight and some flowers. Dressing nicely, Ellis and I made our way to the poolside, excited to see what's in store for us. After the staffs greeted us warmly and exchange niceties, we were led to one of the many cabanas beside the pool. Our cabana was a one minute walk away from the bistro in secluded corner of the pool. They have replaced the bed with a square table in the cabana where we are having our dinner. A soft and warm light awash the cozy shelter and a gentle draft came from the ceiling fan. It was perfect for romantic dinner. As we are seated, our personal waiter of the night introduced himself and the dishes we would be having. Entree was tomato and cheese, followed by beef for the mains, con

	h2 Water Sports at Nusar Dua
	.story We were at Nusar Dua for a day of water sports. The guide from Jet Set Marine briefed us on our activities and got us all excited. The company owns this private area of the beach and they were stocked with scuba diving gears, snorkelling gears, water sports boats and jet ski. Flying fish was the first activity. As we lie cluelessly on the inflated boat, I thought to myself, "Is that it?" Maybe they were going to make some fishes fly over us? Then the assistant on the boat asked, "Ready?" My mind was racing, "Oh wait, there's more? OH YEAH!" He gave an thumbs-up signal and the boat picked up speed. We had lift-off. Our boat, with us on it, was incredibly flying 45 degrees through the air. Who came up with this crazy idea?

	.story Two more lift-offs and we headed back to the beach. We were getting into the mood. Wake slider was up next. This one took a brutal toll on the body. We sat in an inflatable square boat with four pockets (so four people can play this together) and the speed boat drags you along at high speed in zig-zag motion. The inflatable boat bumped up and down, pulled and threw us in every direction when it crossed path with the wake of the speed boat. Five minutes later, we were utterly destroyed. Wake slider was too painful to be enjoyable.

	h2 Parasailing
	.story Parasailing is the highlight of the trip. It is what we came for - to be hooked up to a parachute and tethered to a speedboat moving at top speed. The forward motion generates a lift on the parchute like a kite. High up in the air, people, boats and buildings looked like ants. We got a spectacular birds-eye view of Nusar Dua and beyond. This was close as I will ever get to flying. The sky was clear, the sun made the water sparkled on this balmy day. I was in heaven. After ten minutes, we floated back down to earth. It was over too quickly.

	.story Barely catching our breath, we speeded back to the private beach. It is time for jet skiing. Two jet skis have been prepared for us. An assistant sat behind each of us - they are there to guide and save us in trouble. Operating the jet ski was easy. The throttle is a lever on the handlebar that you squeeze to both start and accelerate the engine. A tiny squeeze and the engine roared to life. It took a few trials to get the right amount of pressure on the lever. My first few attempts almost ripped my hands off my shoulders as the jet ski jerked forward.

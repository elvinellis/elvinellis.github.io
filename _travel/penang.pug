	h2 Life in George Town
	.story Life in George town goes on at a slower pace than the city life in Singapore. People are not in a hurry to get anywhere. That was my first impression when my family took a short break at Penang. We put up at Cititel which was near to most places we want to go.

	.story We hit the streets to the nearby market for breakfast. Hawkers lined the streets selling meat, vegetables, clothes, houseware and toys next to one another in a boisterous atmosphere. All products were displayed at once. It was an organised mess of a thousand things to look at. The locals tittle-tattled and bargained with sellers. The colors, smell and noise surrounds you.

	.story We got to the eating area where tables were set up and pushcart hawkers were busy wiping up dishes for customers. It will look like a normal empty ground if you took all that away. You were free to seat anywhere and order from any carts. It was like a mini impromptu hawker centre. Breakfast was a simple affair for us - fish ball kueh tiao soup paired with fragrant kopi.
	.story The next few days, we got around mainly on the free bus route for tourist, taxi and using our feets. George Town isn't that big so any bus ride will take less than half an hour. There was one mode of transport which we didn't try and that was the rickshaw.

	.story There were shop houses everywhere. Over here, tall modern buildings are a minority. Each shop on the ground floor deal in different business from the one next to it. As I walked down the road, it may well had been an outdoor shopping centre.

	h2 Penang Hill
	.story Penang Hill, or Bukit Bendera, is a short 6 km bus ride from George Town. We reached the base of the hill early in the morning and were among the first to take a ride up on the Penang Hill Railway. When we reached the peak at about 700 metres, the air became cooler and misty. We were walking in the clouds.

	.story It was now time to go down the way we came up. We took the front row seats on the train. Ellis took a hyper-lapse video of the journey. You get a sense of the steepness. The are two trains that acted as counter balance for each other. As one train goes up, the other has two go down on the same track. In the middle of the video at 0:08, you will see the track fork into two and quickly merge back into one. The trains pass each other at the switching lanes. It is ingenious design.

	h2 Upside Down Museum
	.story In one of the shop houses along Kimberley Street, there is an Upside Down Museum. In a place where every thing down is up, you can take photos that is out of this world. There were staffs, who looked like students, in every room that will take your camera, guide you on how best to pose and then take photos for you.

	.story For massive objects, like a table, hovering above your head, you hope those were screwed ecurely into the ceiling. The smaller objects and blanket on bed baffled my mind. Did someone apply super glue to the bottom and then held the objects down, I mean up, while waiting for the glue to dry? I guess no one has been killed by falling red rocking horse in the nursery room yet.

	h2 Camera Museum
	.story As both of us were mad over cameras at the moment, Ellis and I took a short walk from our hotel to visit the Camera Museum. We were not disappointed as the place has a collection of old cameras from various times. Some of them were out of the glass display and I had a great time looking through the lens of vintage cameras trying to frame the scene.

	.story The Mamiya RB67 (Rotating Back 6 x 7) was considered a workhorse of its time - 1970s. Built like a tank, you still can buy a used working copy online. There was a Mamiya 645 Gold Lizard special edition beside that shouts out gangsta bling bling. I will not take any photographer seriously if he was using one. Next, we have the Yashica-D, A and Mat in a row - line'em them up! These were 6x6 TLR (Twin Lens Reflex) from an even earlier 1930s to 1950s. The top lens projected the scene onto the ground glass focusing screen, while the bottom lens took the picture. When you focused, both lens were adjusted at the same time. Because we had TLR, we then had SLR which use mirror, prism, and a single lens. And today, we have the DSLR when film gave way to digital sensor.

	.story Before we have the Olympus OM-D MFT cameras, we had the Olympus OM series. Looking at the Olympus OM-10 on display, I could see how the design of the original OM series shaped the design of the OMD digital cameras. The Leica R5 is a more modern looking design of the Leica series. We played with some box cameras that were so large, it had to be placed on a table. We used our digital camera to take a photo of the image projected through the imaging lens on to the fresnel focus screen. Now, that's a photo of a photo - trippy.

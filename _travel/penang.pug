	h2 Life in George Town
	.story Life in George town goes on at a slower pace than the city life in Singapore. People are not in a hurry to get anywhere. That was my first impression when my family took a short break at Penang. We put up at Cititel which was near to most places we want to go.

	.story We hit the streets to the nearby market for breakfast. Hawkers lined the streets selling meat, vegetables, clothes, houseware and toys next to one another in a boisterous atmosphere. All of the products were displayed at once. It was an organised mess of a thousand things to look at. The locals tittle-tattled and bargained with sellers. The colors, smell and noise surrounded us.

	.story We got to the eating area where tables were set up and pushcart hawkers were busy whipping up dishes for customers. It will look like a normal empty ground if you took all that away. You were free to seat anywhere and to order from any carts. It was like a mini impromptu hawker centre. Breakfast was a simple affair for us - fish ball kueh tiao soup paired with fragrant kopi.
	.story The next few days, we got around mainly on the free bus route for tourist, taxi and using our feets. George Town isn't that big so any bus ride will take less than half an hour. There was one mode of transport which we didn't try and that was the rickshaw.

	h2 Architecture
	.story George Town has many old buildings. The roads and streets looked worn but generally well-maintained and clean. Temples had elaborate carvings and adornments of mythical creatures. I even saw one roof that had triangle spikes.

	.story There were shop houses everywhere. Most of them are run-down and looked like they have seen better years. Over here, tall modern buildings are a minority. Each shop on the ground floor deal in different business from the one next to it. As I walked down the road, it may well had been an outdoor shopping centre.

	.story We tried many local dishes here: Chendol, Char Kueh Tiao, Char Kueh Kak, Duck Kueh Chup, Curry Mee, Bak Kut Teh. Many of them are available here but rendered in a slightly different style. The egg tarts, tau sar piah and beh teh saw were delicious. We bought several boxes back to Singapore.

	h2 Kek Lok Si
	.story Which means Temple of Supreme Bliss. What a name. We climbed up what feels like a hundred steps through dark alley flanked by shops and under-construction walkways to reach the temple. Our eyes are in for a treat. The white pagoda is made from three sections of distinct style starting from the top: Burmese, Thai and Chinese. Walking through the temple feels like maze where extensions of rooms and buildings were added as an afterthought. The smell of incense pervaded the air and chantings echoes out of rooms and along corridors. I always feel a sense of peace inside a temple and I got the same easy feeling here.

	.story The bronze statue of Guanyin was further up on the peak accessible by a diagonal lift. Construction was still on-going to build a pavilion over the statue. At thirty metres tall, one feels puny looking up at the statue.

	h2 Penang Hill
	.story Penang Hill, or Bukit Bendera, is a short 6 km bus ride from George Town. We reached the base of the hill early in the morning and were among the first to take a ride up on the Penang Hill Railway. When we reached the peak at about 700 metres, the air became cooler and misty. We were walking in the clouds.

	.story It was now time to go down the way we came up. We took the front row seats on the train. Ellis took a hyper-lapse video of the journey. You get a sense of the steepness. The are two trains that acted as counter balance for each other. As one train went up, the other descends on the same track. In the middle of the video at 0:08, you can see the track fork into two and quickly merge back into one. The trains passed each other at the switching lanes. It was an ingenious design to me.

	.story I wonder if those massive objects, like a table hovering above my head, were screwed securely into the ceiling. The smaller objects and blanket on bed were astonishing. Did someone apply super glue to the bottom and then held the objects down, I mean up, and waited for the glue to dry? I guess no one has been killed by that falling red rocking horse in the nursery room yet.

	.story The Mamiya RB67 (Rotating Back 6 x 7) was considered a workhorse of its time - 1970s. Built like a tank, you still can buy a used working copy online. Beside it was Mamiya 645 Gold Lizard special edition. Next, we have the Yashica-D, A and Mat lined up in a row. These were 6x6 TLR (Twin Lens Reflex) from an even earlier 1930s to 1950s. The top lens projected the scene onto the ground glass focusing screen, while the bottom lens took the picture. When you focused, both lens were adjusted at the same time. Because we had TLR, we then had SLR which use mirror, prism, and a single lens. And today, we have the DSLR when film gave way to digital sensor.

	.story Before we have the Olympus OM-D MFT cameras, we had the Olympus OM series. Looking at the Olympus OM-10 on display, I could see how the design of the original OM series shaped the design of the OM-D digital cameras. The Leica R5 is a more modern looking design of the Leica series. We played with some box cameras that were so large, it had to be placed on a table. We used our digital camera to take a photo of the image projected through the imaging lens on to the fresnel focus screen. Now, that's a photo of a photo - trippy.

	.story Some parts of Penang was well-preserved. It was like time travelling back and still having all your modern amenties and gadgets. Taller buildings have sprung up and may continue to replace the old shophouses. Visit them before they are gone.

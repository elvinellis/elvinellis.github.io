	h3 4 February, Saturday (Week 1) - Welcome Home
	.story #[.ellis] It has been exactly a week since the D-Day. I am still looking at the photos of Audrey in her first hour of arrival. It seems like her face changes every day and I can't catch up. I must say the first week is horrible. I always know that when we introduce a new activity in our lifestyle, there bound to be time needed to settle down. I once experienced it when I first moved in to Elvin's house after married. It took us a while to get the routine back and be able to do things at the most efficient way.

	.story And now, the new challenge is here. This time round seems harder because I have to deal with the pain in me on top of the new routine to set up. Throughout the first week, I think I was emotional. I can easily cry over little things. It must be the hormones!

	.story I had difficulty in getting Audrey to latch on and Audrey's suckle power is super strong. It hurts so much that I decided for Audrey to begin with formula milk after first night. I felt depressed at times when I have majority of the people asking me whether I breastfed Audrey. I am not a strong believer of breastmilk especially so when I need to eat the Chinese confinement food. I feel unhealthy and I do no wish to feed Audrey with this. I felt that my milk will only be good when I am back to my usual diet when I get to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, meat and drink lots of plain water and fresh milk. With this and the sore nipples from the first night, I did not express the milk out. By day 5, I felt cold and shivering. I guess my breasts were engorged without me knowing. Well, it got everybody worked up and I got some scoldings here and there. I felt depressed but luckily, Elvin is always by my side and he was not giving me any pressure to breastfeed. I thank God for that.

	.story After all these pains, seeing Audrey breathing every second, moving her limbs and making different expressions, just warm me and make me feel happy. A dream come true. Audrey is now sleeping soundly on the cot. Elvin managed to capture many moments of Audrey. I love the smiley face of her! 

	.story I will still stroll through my photo album in the handphone for Audrey's photos. I can never get tired of seeing her. Haha! As for Elvin, I can tell he is purely excited being a daddy. Although we are sleep deprived, he still makes effort to read and sing to Audrey. And with each passing day, Audrey is growing up too quickly!

	.story #[.elvin] Audrey is the cutest baby ever. She looks intensely you with her big eyes without blinking, as if studying every detail of your face. When she is done with feeding, she just knocks out in your hands. Her arms will be dangling down, her eyes shut tight and her tiny mouth gap open. Give her a minute or two to recover her consciousness. During her deep slumber, she will smile once or twice as if she is enjoying her milk. She will then open her eyes sleepily. If you tilt her upright at this moment, she may give a loud and wet burp. At times, she just refuses to burp even after she downs 60 ml of milk in one sitting.

	.story She was afraid of the water when we bathed her the first time, letting off a wail. But she is getting better at the end of the week. At least, she is not crying now. When she yawns, she like to end it off with a funny growl that goes "krrrack". I wonder where did she pick that up from. She sleeps in whatever ways she feels comfortable: both hands above head; both hands under cheek; one hand under cheek and the other hand extends out. She makes sounds when she sleeps. Sometimes a whimper or a short cry. The first few night, I thought she wanted attention but it was false alarms. Now, we wait awhile longer before checking on her.

	.story Alas, babies don't come with a manual so we are figuring out what works for her through trial and error. Our first visit to the pedaetrician was a success. Dr. Eugene Han said she has maintained her weight which means she is feeding well. Most babies lose weight in the first week. The bilirubin level is 120 vs 105 umol/L when she was first tested. We did gave her a little sun in the morning so she didn't suffer from jaundice. That was a great relief to us. She had acid reflux at first but it has improved too as we fed her upright and gave her a daily dose of probiotics.

	.story At home, her Ye Ye and Nai Nai is thrilled to see her. Babies have this magical aura of making grown-ups smile and want to do things for them. Ellis arranged for B&G Life Casting team to come down and do the a cast of Audrey's hands and feets. We haven't got the final product yet but the nice lady, J.J., made foot prints of Audrey onto a piece of paper. I scanned the footprints in, put in some texture and Ellis added the text. The end result is a nice wallpaper.

	h3 11 February, Saturday (Week 2) - Farts and Poops
	.story #[.elvin] Audrey farts and poops a lot. As her gastrointestinal tract is still developing, the gas in tummy gave her great discomfort. The first few nights were bad as she arched her back, flexed her limbs and cried out in pain. We were in pain too as we watched. All we could do was comfort her and rub her tummy gently. She is more accustomed to the tummy gas now. I watched her giving only a whimper as she arches her back and forced the fart out one by one. It is hilarious to hear them popping out loudly.  We switched her formula milk to NAN 1 with partially hydrolysed protein. Hopefully, this milk along with the breast milk will be easier for her tummy.

	.video(data="qtO0oKhDA-A")

	.story A funny thing happened. Ellis and I were changing her diaper after she left a golden mess in it. We thought she was done but apparently she was not. I stuck my hand in to clean her bum when a torrent of water gooey shit shot out. It hit my hand and the shit radiate outwards, splashing some on Ellis arms, the bed and the floor. I jumped back from the shock. Within a second, all hell broke loose. I went to wash my hands and get reinforcement from my mom. I wasn't sure which was a better choice - to breathe through my nose or mouth. It took us a good half an hour to clean up Audrey and ourselves, and change the bed sheet. Throughout the shit storm, Audrey was oblivious to the smell that engulfed the room and looked calmly satisfied in letting it go.

	.story This was the second week of my paternity leave and that gave me plenty of free time with Audrey. I watched her sleep more than half the time. She has many fine hairs covering her skin which are mesmerising to watch. When she is awake, we read to her "The Cat in the Hat" and "The Cat in the Hat Comes Back". They are funny stories. She may not understand them now but someday she will. Apart from reading, we sing songs to her too. My favourites are "Spring is Here", "In the City" and "Little Virus". I think she likes them too as she listen with a serious face. She likes her toes to be counted. When I pull on it one by one, she is figuring out what is happening. Her toes are so tiny, it is incredible to watch them.

	.story #[.ellis] The feeling of being a mother has still yet to settle in me. Really? Am I a mother now? Do I really have a daughter? These questions, I probably never thought they would be a 'yes'. It feels unreal. Will I be a good mother? Will I be able to take good care of Audrey? Even more questions for myself now... 

	.story Cooping myself in the house for straight 3 weeks is a feat. Oh my... I feel so emo sometimes that I cannot even get out of house. The only time I am out is when I dispose of rubbish. This is terrible and makes me so grumpy. That is why I am really counting down to the end of confinement. Although I think the daily routine will not change much after confinement, I still look forward to it, at least I can eat things I want to eat and go out groceries shopping.

	.story And when it gets really emo staying at home, I yearn for people to visit me. As I am still staying in my in law's place, it is not as convenient. Still, some of my friends and family came. This instantly lit up my spirit. I realise I miss them so much!

	.story Every week is like a challenge. Audrey has some difficulty drinking her milk and makes her drink very small amount in each feed. We ended up feeding her almost every hour. We thought of many causes such as the teat flow rate, reflux or blocked nose. We fed her with probiotics to tackle the reflux issue. We used saline drop to soften her mucous and dig them out. After these are done, her feeding got better. It was a relieved to be able to see her feed well. She is satisfied and we are happy too! 

	.story Much as I do not want her to grow up too fast, I am looking forward to the time she can feed on solids and I will be able to prepare many delicious purees for her.

	.story #[.ellis] It is the third week of my confinement. I am counting down to the end of it. There are simply too many 'rules' aka old wives' tales that are too hard to follow. For example, one of them is that the mother cannot touch water. So how am I going to wash the bottles? And for the 'cannot shower' part, I totally ignored because my rash came back, big time. I need to keep clean, so I have to shower. If any of the tales came true, I shall update during my old age. Haha.

	.story Other than confinement, the time spent with Audrey is happiness... In the day. LOL. Because I am still getting into the routine of disrupted sleeps at night. It is hard. Luckily, Elvin did the night shift even though he had to work the following day. This is no joke. It is tired until~ but I am sure we will get used to it in no time.

	.story This week, Audrey made her first sound. She is usually very active in the morning. When Granny and Mummy keep talking and singingto her all day and all night, she is motivated to warm up her vocal cords. I recorded it in audio and video. This is happiness. She sounded so cute! Alright, confirm biased opinion but of course, she is cute to begin with! Haha. 

	.videoset(data="KeMNb1DHEEY,DlNtX5m3UVA,OOXcEvgMA8c")

	.story #[.elvin] Audrey is three weeks old and I think her body is a little longer, her head is slightly bigger and she feels heavier in my arms. Fats have sprouted around her cheeks, elbows and knees. I suspect they come from her constant gorging on milk. I think she looks a tad different from last week. Kids, they grow so fast. I'm back at work now so I can only see her when I get home. I heard she wants to be carried all day now. If she is left alone, she will make sounds to attract your attention. Ignore her long enough and it becomes a wail.

	.story I was at work when Ellis sent me audio clips of the sound Audrey is making. We think she is practising her vocal cords as she makes many short grunts, shrieks, yelps and sighs. She is more aware of her surroundings now as she will look around, listen to our voice and try to respond. Occasionally, she will give us her golden smile. The smile that sets a thousand other faces smiling.

	.story At night, we take turns to wake up to make milk for her. Sometimes I am so sleepy, I don't hear her crying for food. That poor little girl. She is so tired and yet her hunger wakes her into a wail. When I am making the milk, my sleepy eyes can hardly see the markings on the milk bottle as I try to pour 90 ml of water. Add three scoops of milk powder and milk is ready for Audrey. Thank god for formula milk.

	.story My favourite activity with Audrey this week is "Flipping Tummies". It is where I flip her on her tummy and she rest on mine. I can feel tiny heart beating rapidly against my chest. She squirms around as she tries to make sense of this new experience. After a while, she falls asleep. Other times, I flip her on a tummy and give her a back massage. Lying on her back the whole time mustn't be fun so this should give her some relief. Once she fell asleep during the massage.

Starting from a small dot, the cells multiply rapidly, then slow, then increase in pace again, and sometimes it pauses. Growth of a foetus is like making many small sprints on a long journey. The only record of our baby's progress is in the ultrasound snapshots from each doctor's visit. Every minute, we draw closer to the big day where we invite baby to the world and become parents.

Every morning between to 2 am to 3 am, I have an urgent need to pee. And then I lay sleepily back on bed and now I feel hungry. I close my eyes hoping my weariness will overcome my hunger pangs. Nope, hunger wins so I sit up in the dark and munch through bread and biscuits. Ah, the woes of a pregnant mum.

	.story Getting out of the doctor's office, our eyes were glued to the television. It was the live broadcast of Joseph Schooling's match: the 100m butterfly final of Rio 2016. From the time Joe sprung off the board, the whole clinic was cheering for him. He was ahead of the pack. At the turn, he pulled ahead further and was a body length ahead when he touched the end of the pool. The crowd went wild. It was over in 50.39 second. An Olympic Record for the a 100m butterfly and finally a gold medal for Singapore. We were ecstatic to witness this historic moment together with baby.

	.story #[.elvin] It has been two weeks since we saw baby. The past few days were not good. First, the yearly haze has returned. The PSI went above 200. That left us scrambling for N95 masks and air purifier. In the last two days, the news broke that the Zika virus was detected on our shores. Forty-one infected cases have been found so far. As the Zika virus is harmful to pregnant mother, we are finding ways and means to keep mummy and baby safe. That means closing the door, not letting the mosquito in, doing the five-steps mozzie wipe out and dousing mummy with insect repellant. We hope to tide through this difficult time safe and sound.

	.story #[.elvin] Today is baby's day out. It has been a while since we went on a date. We caught the movie - The Secret Life of Pets, at The Cathay. Then we had peanut butter and maple crepe, followed by shopping at Uniqlo flagship store. We had so much fun that we didn't realise how quickly the time has past. Mummy cut her hair short yesterday as it is so tiring to dry her hair every night now. Every now and then, mummy feels the tiny kicks from baby. Baby is growing stronger day by day. We have came up with a few names to choose from and in order of preference: Audrey, Vera, Stella, Mabel, and Charlotte.

	.story #[.elvin] Baby is kicking a lot these day. If I put my head against Mummy's tummy, each kick feels liks a gentle flick. We get excited when baby does that. Mummy weighs 60 kg now. For three times a week after dinner, we will read to baby from books on general knowlege and bedtime stories. Most of the time, Daddy falls asleep after the story. On Saturday afternoon, we have English and Math lessons. Maybe it is because we forgot about today's lesson that baby is kicking so much. For dinner, we made two different type of pizzas: chicken with capsicum and portobello mushroom with cheddar cheese. It was so yummy that Mummy ate two large slices. We are waiting eagerly to see baby via the ultrasound next Saturday.

	.story In the afternoon, we took a guided tour of TMC (Thomson Medical Centre). There were the patient service center, delivery rooms, nursery room, and private rooms for resting after birth. Ellis and I were excited to see the babies in the nursery. Wrapped in a white bundle, only the head stuck out. After the tour, we rushed over to Suntec Convention for a talk titled #[i Smart Parents]. We learnt about the child's brain development, how pregnant moms can continue to look beautiful after birth and understanding common symptoms of a new-born baby. Ellis says she is going to write out notes for that. I'm looking forward to reading them.

	.story #[.ellis] I took urgent leave today as I just don't have the energy. This is a privilege of a mother-to-be... Recently, I am bothered by two things. Discharge and constipation. I have weird discharge so I think my infection is back again... And as I hit the 5-months mark, constipations set in. Oh gosh, the daily woes in the toilet. I was advised not to force the poo out but to eat more yogurt and drink prune juice. Subsequently, the constipated feeling subsided. Baby, mummy is trying to poo so please don't misunderstand that your delivery time is due! Continue to stay inside and grow healthily in comfort, okie?

	.story #[.ellis] Daddy has to work late so I have my private time with Baby for our regular lesson time. Today's topic is about things we can do with our children, learning about mixing colours using watercolours and painting and drawing. I am looking forward to doing such activities when Baby grows up.<br>

	.story I always love to sing, oblivious to my audience and environment. Usually, I sing a few nursery rhymes and songs I learn from English Time on Saturdays, and Baby will kick as I sing! It felt like she is joining me in the singing. At least, that's what I want to think. Haha. I decided to sing some pop songs in my Spotify list! I started with a few English songs and there wasn't much reaction from my bump. Then, I proceeded to sing my favourite Chinese pop songs with passion. The amazing thing was I got multiple kicks from baby!! I stopped and continued a while later - just to check if I was imagining things... Seriously, I am not imagining! The kicks were as if Baby was running inside! Well, I strongly believe she likes chinese songs more. When I told Daddy about it, his view was that baby did not like Chinese songs and was 'objecting' to it when I sang. Hmmm, I shall ask baby when she is out next year!

	.story #[.ellis] We woke up early in the morning and tried to clear our housework - weekly clothes washing before we set off for our monthly visit to the gynae. Although we slept late the night before, we were not a least bit tired for waking up early and going through a mad rush just to be in time for our appointment. All because of our dearest little baby growing inside me. Daddy prepared Edamame and packed some nuts for our outing today. Shortly after we reached the clinic and went through the usual urine test, weight and blood pressure measurement, we were called to the gynae's office. Our gynae explained the fetal assessment in details and then measured the length between my groin to belly button. I guess he is measuring the uterus length to track the growth.

	.story He then did a scan using a fetal doppler to listen to baby's heartbeat. Daddy and mummy can never be tired of listening to the rhythmic and strong heartbeat of baby. The heartbeat always bring a blissful smile to us. Next, he used the ultrasound scan and swiftly found baby's head, heart, stomach , arms and thigh. That is like more than half the time faster than the sonographer! My eyes and ears cannot keep track to his speed! 

	.story After that, the gynae did a swap test on mummy due to potential infection in vaginal which may be dangerous at this stage. It was painful to mummy and the pain lasted about a day. Mummy had difficulty peeing and teared. All mummy wants is for baby to be safe and sound. Baby, mummy love you!

	.story Daddy has been working hard for the baby too! Besides earning money to support us, he also researched on the camera lens and gadgets and get himself ready for baby's photoshoot! Mummy, on the other hand, is in charge of getting the necessary props ready. We went to Spotlight to look for cloths that can be the backdrop for baby. Eventually, we bought a pastel printed cloth as one of baby's outfit!

	.story We also popped by our favourite money-spending shop - Uniqlo and got a set of newborn rompers for our baby! Our first little gift for baby! As mummy feels tired more often nowadays, we wrapped up our shopping after a fulfilling lunch at Ichiban Sushi.

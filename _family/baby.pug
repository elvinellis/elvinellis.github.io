Starting from a small dot, the cells multiply rapidly, then slow, then increase in pace again, and sometimes it pauses. Growth of a foetus is like making many small sprints on a long journey. The only record of our baby's progress is in the ultrasound snapshots from each doctor's visit. Every minute, we draw closer to the big day where we invite baby to the world and become parents.

Every morning between to 2 am to 3 am, I have an urgent need to pee. And then I lay sleepily back on bed and now I feel hungry. I close my eyes hoping my weariness will overcome my hunger pangs. Nope, hunger wins so I sit up in the dark and munch through bread and biscuits. Ah, the woes of a pregnant mum.

This is first time I am hearing the heartbeat. I was ordered to walk less and rest more so I took some days off. Staying at home is boring but keeping baby safe is more important.

	.story Getting out of the doctor's office, our eyes were glued to the television. It was the live broadcast of Joseph Schooling's match: the 100m butterfly final of Rio 2016. From the time Joe sprung off the board, the whole clinic was cheering for him. He was ahead of the pack. At the turn, he pulled ahead further and was a body length ahead when he touched the end of the pool. The crowd went wild. It was over in 50.39 second. An Olympic Record for the a 100m butterfly and finally a gold medal for Singapore. We were ecstatic to witness this historic moment together with baby.

	.story It has been two weeks since we saw baby. The past few days were not good. First, the yearly haze has returned. The PSI went above 200. That left us scrambling for N95 masks and air purifier. In the last two days, the news broke that the Zika virus was detected on our shores. Forty-one infected cases have been found so far. As the Zika virus is harmful to pregnant mother, we are finding ways and means to keep mummy and baby safe. That means closing the door, not letting the mosquito in, doing the five-steps mozzie wipe out and dousing mummy with insect repellant. We hope to tide through this difficult time safe and sound.

	.story Today is baby's day out. It has been a while since we went on a date. We caught the movie - The Secret Life of Pets, at The Cathay. Then we had peanut butter and maple crepe, followed by shopping at Uniqlo flagship store. We had so much fun that we didn't realise how quickly the time has past. Mummy cut her hair short yesterday as it is so tiring to dry her hair every night now. Every now and then, mummy feels the tiny kicks from baby. Baby is growing stronger day by day. We have came up with a few names to choose from and in order of preference: Audrey, Vera, Stella, Mabel, and Charlotte.

	.story Baby is kicking a lot these day. If I put my head against Mummy's tummy, each kick feels liks a gentle flick. We get excited when baby does that. Mummy weighs 60 kg now. For three times a week after dinner, we will read to baby from books on general knowlege and bedtime stories. Most of the time, Daddy falls asleep after the story. On Saturday afternoon, we have English and Math lessons. Maybe it is because we forgot about today's lesson that baby is kicking so much. For dinner, we made two different type of pizzas: chicken with capsicum and portobello mushroom with cheddar cheese. It was so yummy that Mummy ate two large slices. We are waiting eagerly to see baby via the ultrasound next Saturday.

Ellis and I were excited to see the babies in the nursery. Wrapped in a white bundle, only the head and arms stuck out. After the tour, we rushed over to Suntec Convention for a talk titled #[i Smart Parents]. We learnt about the child's brain development, how pregnant moms can continue to look beautiful after birth and understanding common symptoms of a new-born baby. Ellis says she is going to write out notes for that. I'm looking forward to reading them.

Starting from a small dot, the cells multiply rapidly, then slow, then increase in pace again, and sometimes it pauses. Growth of a foetus is like making many small sprints on a long journey. The only record of our baby's progress is in the ultrasound snapshots from each doctor's visit. Every minute, we draw closer to the big day where we invite baby to the world and become parents.

	.story #[.ellis] I feel my body going through many changes at once. I become hyper-sensitive to smell, nauseated in front of some food and have higher body temperature. Every morning between to 2 am to 3 am, I have an urgent need to pee. And then I lay sleepily back on bed and now I feel hungry. I close my eyes hoping my weariness will overcome my hunger pangs. Nope, hunger wins so I sit up in the dark and munch through bread and biscuits. Ah, the woes of a pregnant mum.

This is first time I am hearing the heartbeat. I was ordered to walk less and rest more so I took some days off. Staying at home is boring but keeping baby safe is more important.

	.story Getting out of the doctor's office, our eyes were glued to the television. It was the live broadcast of Joseph Schooling's match: the 100m butterfly final of Rio 2016. From the time Joe sprung off the board, the whole clinic was cheering for him. He was ahead of the pack. At the turn, he pulled ahead further and was a body length ahead when he touched the end of the pool. The crowd went wild. It was over in 50.39 second. An Olympic Record for the a 100m butterfly and finally a gold medal for Singapore. We were ecstatic to witness this historic moment together with baby.

	h3 29 August, Monday (Week 17) - Haze and Zika
	.story #[.elvin] It has been two weeks since we saw baby. The past few days were not good. First, the yearly haze has returned. The PSI went above 200. That left us scrambling for N95 masks and air purifier. In the last two days, the news broke that the Zika virus was detected on our shores. Forty-one infected cases have been found so far. As the Zika virus is harmful to pregnant mother, we are finding ways and means to keep Mommy and baby safe. That means closing the door, not letting the mosquito in, doing the five-steps mozzie wipe out and dousing Mommy with insect repellant. We hope to tide through this difficult time safe and sound.

	.story #[.elvin] Today is baby's day out. It has been a while since we went on a date. We caught the movie - The Secret Life of Pets, at The Cathay. Then we had peanut butter and maple crepe, followed by shopping at Uniqlo flagship store. We had so much fun that we didn't realise how quickly the time has past. Mommy cut her hair short yesterday as it is so tiring to dry her hair every night now. Every now and then, Mommy feels the tiny kicks from baby. Baby is growing stronger day by day. We have came up with a few names to choose from and in order of preference: Audrey, Vera, Stella, Mabel, and Charlotte.

	.story #[.elvin] Baby is kicking a lot these day. If I put my head against Mommy's tummy, each kick feels liks a gentle flick. We get excited when baby does that. Mommy weighs 60 kg now. For three times a week after dinner, we will read to baby from books on general knowlege and bedtime stories. Most of the time, I am asleep after the story. On Saturday afternoon, we have English and Math lessons. Maybe it is because we forgot about today's lesson that baby is kicking so much. For dinner, we made two different type of pizzas: chicken with capsicum and portobello mushroom with cheddar cheese. It was so yummy that Mommy ate two large slices. We are waiting eagerly to see baby via the ultrasound next Saturday.

	.story In the afternoon, we took a guided tour of TMC (Thomson Medical Centre). There were the patient service center, delivery rooms, nursery room, and private rooms for resting after birth. Ellis and I were excited to see the babies in the nursery. Wrapped in a white bundle, only the head stuck out. After the tour, we rushed over to Suntec Convention for a talk titled #[i Smart Parents]. We learnt about the child's brain development, how pregnant moms can continue to look beautiful after birth and understanding common symptoms of a new-born baby. Ellis says she is going to write out notes for that. I'm looking forward to reading them.

	.story #[.ellis] I took urgent leave today as I just don't have the energy. This is a privilege of a mother-to-be... Recently, I am bothered by two things. Discharge and constipation. I have weird discharge so I think my infection is back again... And as I hit the five-months mark, constipations set in. Oh gosh, the daily woes in the toilet. I was advised not to force the poo out but to eat more yogurt and drink prune juice. Subsequently, the constipated feeling subsided. Baby, Mommy is trying to poo so please don't misunderstand that your delivery time is due! Continue to stay inside and grow healthily in comfort, okie?

Today's topic is about things we can do with our children, learning about mixing colours using watercolours and painting and drawing. I am looking forward to doing such activities when Baby grows up.<br>

	.story I always love to sing, oblivious to my audience and environment. Usually, I sing a few nursery rhymes and songs I learn from English Time on Saturdays, and Baby will kick as I sing! It felt like she is joining me in the singing. At least, that's what I want to think. Haha. I decided to sing some pop songs in my Spotify list! I started with a few English songs and there wasn't much reaction from my bump. Then, I proceeded to sing my favourite Chinese pop songs with passion. The amazing thing was I got multiple kicks from baby!! I stopped and continued a while later - just to check if I was imagining things... Seriously, I am not! The kicks were as if Baby was running inside! Well, I strongly believe she likes chinese songs more. When I told Daddy about it, his view was that baby did not like Chinese songs and was 'objecting' to it when I sang. Hmmm, I shall ask baby when she is out next year!

	.story #[.ellis] We woke up early in the morning to clear our housework - washing our weekly set of clothes before we set off for our monthly visit to the gynae. Although we slept late the night before, we were not a least bit tired waking up early and going through a mad rush to be in time for our appointment. All this for our dear little baby. Daddy prepared edamame and some nuts for our outing today. Shortly after reaching the clinic, I went through the usual urine test, weight and blood pressure measurement. In the Dr Tseng's office, he explained the fetal assessment and then measured the length between my groin and belly button. I guess he is measuring the uterus length to track the growth.

	.story He then did a scan using a fetal doppler to listen to Baby's heartbeat. Daddy and Mommy are never tired of listening to the rhythmic and strong heartbeat of baby. The heartbeat always bring a blissful smile to us. Next, he used the ultrasound scan and swiftly found Baby's head, heart, stomach, arms and thigh. That is like more than half the time faster than the sonographer! My eyes and ears cannot keep track with his speed! 

	.story After that, the gynae did a swap test on Mommy due to potential infection in her vagina which may be dangerous at this stage. It was painful to Mommy and the pain lasted about a day. Mommy had difficulty peeing and teared. All Mommy wants is for baby to be safe and sound. Baby, Mommy love you!

	.story Daddy has been working hard for the baby too! Besides earning money to support us, he also researched on the camera lens and gadgets and get himself ready for Baby's photoshoot! Mommy, on the other hand, is in charge of getting the necessary props ready. We went to Spotlight to look for cloths that can be the backdrop for the photo. Eventually, we bought a pastel-printed cloth as one of Baby's outfits!

	.story We also popped by our favourite money-spending shop - Uniqlo and got a set of newborn rompers for our baby! Our first little gift for baby! As Mommy feels tired more often nowadays, we wrapped up our shopping after a fulfilling lunch at Ichiban Sushi.

	h3 15 October, Saturday (Week 23) - Audrey
	.story #[.elvin] Audrey. That's the name we decided for Baby. It has a nice sweet ring to it and you get to curl your tongue over the "dr" part like "Auddrrey". It's neither short nor a mouthful to call. Together with her surname, "Audrey Chua" sounds perfect. According to wikipedia, the name Audrey is a combination of the old English words: Noble and Strength. Well, I like that. More importantly, it is a name that both Mommy and I like.
	.story Mommy has caught the insomnia bug recently - it means she wakes up at 3 a.m. and cannot sleep again until 5 a.m. During this period, Audrey is mostly awake which she knows from the kicking. The next morning, it takes Mommy a long time to wake up. I have to nudge and convince her to trudge to the toilet to wash up. After that, it's mostly fine. Now that I have a decent lens (24-105 mm), I am practicing to take good portraits of her in the morning. Mommy is looking beautiful in this dress. I expect the bulge of her tummy to increase quickly in the next few weeks.

	.story On other news, I'm back to army camp this week and for the next two weeks. It means that I have to wake up early and miss the train ride with Mommy to work. Hang in there, babe!

	h3 16 October, Sunday (Week 24) - Baby Fair
	.story #[.ellis] There was a baby fair going on at Singapore Expo and we thought we should start getting Baby's stuff slowly before my tummy gets bigger. We had MacDonald's breakfast in the morning before setting off to see what there were at the fair.

	.story As usual, there were alot of marketing personnel trying to sell their products such as Insurance and cord preservation. We combed through the fair wanted to get a mattress but there wasn't any that fits the baby cot that my brother is giving us. We ended up looking at breastpumps and finding reviews online. Our shopping spree at the end of the day were breastpumps, milk bottle Steriliser and Warmer, and a special Warmer for breastmilk. Those stuff already kept our hands full. We had to call it a day. 

	.story We then passed by the adjacent hall selling electronic appliances and we bought a food processor after Daddy watched the demonstration the day before, totally convinced of the amazing function! And finally, we took a cab home with hands so full that we couldn't open the car boot!

	h3 20 October, Thursday (Week 24) - Walking about Raffles Place
	.story #[.ellis] It is 24 weeks now, baby Audrey! Mommy is working hard and I know you are too! I took leave today to rest as I have been having my pregnancy insomnia. Occasionally, I also feel the round ligament pain. Nowadays, I don't really know how to differentiate the pains. It just worries me when I feel weird around my tummy. Audrey be safe okie!

	.story Daddy didn't go for his reservice as he had a backache. When I woke up in the morning, Daddy is already busy removing the husks from the bowl of soaked green beans. Guess what? Daddy is going to make a husk pillow for Audrey from scratch. After soaking the beans for 2 days and using 3 hours of manpower, including grandparents help, Daddy sunned the husks for a day. It seems like the quantity of the husks shrunk after they dried. Daddy would most probably need to prepare another batch of beans for the husks. After this, he will be sewing the pillow case for you, Audrey!

	.story After lunch, Mommy and Daddy went to our lawyer's office to hand the two cheques for the TOP notice of our house. Daddy is getting excited! Finally, long awaited house is coming soon. For me, I think I'm only excited about my dressing table and Audrey's nursery!

	.story We then took a walk along Singapore River to Victoria Concert Hall. I saw the replanted giant raintrees. I sat there enjoying the breeze under the tree amidst the hot weather while Daddy went snapping photos. A short date for us on a weekday. The day just passed by so quickly.

	h3 22 October, Saturday (Week 24) - Mung Beans Husks and Pre-natal Class
	.story #[.elvin] We are mung beans husk farmers this week. A batch of mung beans are soaked overnight and the excess water is drained in the morning. The swollen beans having absorbed all the water they can, begin sprouting and growing a long tail in two days. Now, it is time for us to harvest the husk. The green husk slipped out of the bean, revealing the pale yellow body. It looks like a mountain of wet moss after the harvest. After drying, it shrivels and becomes crispy. With all these dry husks, I intend to make a small pillow for Audrey. When the pillow is rested on the baby's tummy, the weight provides a secure feeling. The husks are light and airy, allowing heat and sweat to dissipate. After today's batch, we are one step closer to completing the pillow. What did we do with all that bean sprouts? I cooked them up with sesame oil and a dash of salt to create a yummy dish.

	.story Today, we had pre-natal lesson with Doctor Wong Boh Boi at Ang Mo Kio eXplorerKid. Dr. Wong, she is mildly eccentric. During her class, she would go off-tangent with her anecdotes. Dabbling in a wide range of oriental mystic arts and western scientific pratices, she like the kung-fu master that descended from the snow-capped mountain after years of meditation.

	.story #[.ellis] Mommy has been feeling very grouchy. I easily cry over very minor things that I cannot even pinpoint. Daddy's birthday is around the corner and the only thing Mommy did was to order a cake. Mommy has no energy to scout for a present and a good place for a meal. Hope Daddy can understand. 

	.story I guess the pregnancy insomnia is really taking a toil on me, especially when I have to work on weekdays and I cannot take a nap anytime I want. I missed the lunch treat from your great aunt Karen. I just wanted to sleep in the whole day. Hope this insomnia will get away soon. The only pleasure I get is that I can feel Audrey's kicks in the middle of the night when I am awake as if she is accompanying me through the long sleepless nights!

	.story Today, Mommy and Daddy attended our first lesson with Dr Wong Boh Boi at AMK Hub. Time flew quickly in the two and a half hours weekly class. She shared her knowledge on childbirth, simple pregnancy stretching exercises and breathing. Her father is a TCM physician and she was educated in western medicine. Hence, she busted a number of pregnancy and confinement myths. They were really convincing because she clarified how some myths were derived and passed down. 

	.story After the class, we walked to Cheng San Market to collect Daddy's Pulut Hitam Cake and to have our dinner. A long day ended with two slices of cake from Pine Garden as desserts. Tomorrow, we shall sing Happy Birthday Song to Daddy and cut the yummy birthday cake!

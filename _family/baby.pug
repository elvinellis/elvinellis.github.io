		| We rushed from work to the clinic to do a scan. Found out that there was a slight tear that caused the bleeding. The tear was probably from too much walking and exertion. Dr. Liauw advised for a full bed rest in a serious tone. And also no hanky panky.

		| We did the OSCAR test today. The baby barrel-rolled to show her backbone when the sonologist did thescan. Each bone was so distinct on the screen. We saw the brain, tiny fingers and toes. At one point, it looked like the baby was crossing legs and raising its hands. It was touching to watch.

		| HC 90.89 mm. GA 14w 1d +/1 9d. EDD 10-02-07.<br>
		| Dr Tseng briefed us on the OSCAR report. The stats are all good. Did a scan on the progress of the baby. It is 2cm bigger than before. The heartbeat is stronger. Finally, the doctor thinks we have a girl! Time to think of girls' names.<br>
	.story Getting out of the doctor's office, our eyes were glued to the television. It was the live broadcast of Joseph Schooling's match: the 100m butterfly final of Rio 2016. From the time Joe sprung off the board, the whole clinic was cheering for him. He was ahead of the pack. At the turn, he pulled ahead further and was a body length ahead when he touched the end of the pool. The crowd went wild. It was over in 50.39 second. An Olympic Record for the butterfly and finally a gold medal for Singapore. We were ecstatic to witness this historic moment together with baby.

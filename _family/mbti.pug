				td(colspan=2) A model for managing conflict<br/>
					| Step 1: Create Space<br/>
					| Bringing the views, ideas, and opinions of all vested parties into the dialogue. Fathering facts, verifying assumptions and seeking clarification.<br/>
					| Objective: not only to know diverse views but to understand them.<br/>
					| Action: Change location; active listening, taking breakers, seeking a mediator<br /><br />
					| Step 2: Add Value <br/>
					| Acknowledge the contribution of one's natural preference for decision making hen augment this with the contribution of the opposite function. <br /><br />
					| Step 3: Seek Closure<br>
					| Key activities: (1) Agreeing on Decision Principles, (2) Taking one step at a time, (3) Defining next steps, (4) Closing the book
			tr
				td If you are a TJ <br />
					| Create space: 
					ul
						li Resist your tendency to rush to closure/resolution
						li Practice active listening
						li Use your natural ability to define a reasonable process for all parties involved
					| Add value:
					ul
						li Remember the feelings of others are valid inputs and deserve consideration
						li Silence your internal critic for a while
						li Use your logical analysis to contribute to the process
					| Seek closure:
					ul
						li Keep in mind a drive for total victory may kill small gains
						li Remember, other parties may not be ready to move to this stage if their feelings have not been accepted
						li Having heard all sides, help everyone push toward a resolution
				td If you are a FJ <br />
					| Create space:
					ul
						li Your tendency is to avoid conflict at all costs
						li Your desire for harmony typically makes you uncomfortable standing your ground for very long
						li Use your natural ability to welcome others and their feelings into the dialogue
					| Add value:
					ul
						li Your need for harmony restricts your ability to objectively challenge and critique ideas
						li You may be reluctant to argue a point that challenges others' view but that can add value to the process
						li Your ability to keep all parties engaged and open is extremely valuable
					| Seek closure:
					ul
						li Remember, not everyone views disagreement as irreparably damaging to a relationship
						li Other parties may view your emphasis on feelings as "too soft" or unfocused
						li Your strength in empathizing with all parties and ensuring everyone's needs are met is valued by others

					| Add value:
					ul

						li Their criticism is not personal
						li Safe space is required for them to share their feelings or be open to other's feeling
					| Seek closure:
					ul
						li Once the conflict is closed, they are not likely to reopen it, so be sure you are ready to move on
						li It is likely that they have not addressed emotional aspect of the conflict; these may need to be reconciled first
						li All parties must be prepared to act on what has been agreed
				td In dealing with FJs, be aware that <br />
					| Create space:
					ul
						li They tend to see conflict as painful, negative, and personal experience
						li The feelings of everyone are important to them
						li They may try to rush through the process to avoid the discomfort they experience associated with conflict
					| Add value:
					ul
						li Their focus is first to ensure that everyone is okay with the dialogue
						li Their emotionalism and intensity are not embarassing or inappropriate to them
						li Once they are certain everyone's concerns and feelings have been given credence, they can calmly look at other factors
					| Seek closure:
					ul
						li If there is ill will or lingering frustration, they will not be able to close comfortably even if the decision is unanimous
						li Their "extreme interest" in what you are feeling is not intended to frustrate you or negate the importance of the issue
						li They may later feel pushed aside if their views were not invited in before closing

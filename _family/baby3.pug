If the estimated due date is the bullseye of a dart board, then the actual delivery date is anywhere on the board. As early as thirty-seven weeks or as late as forty-one weeks. As if that variance is not nerve-wrecking enough, we have to second-guess fake contractions and doubting if Mommy just peed or has the water bag burst. Amidst the waiting, we are palpably excited as first-timers. We can hardly hold ourselves back from buying "omg-it's-so-cute-I-wanna-die" clothes. As for Audrey, she is busy growing fat, kicking, pushing her tiny fists against womb and having hiccups.

	.subline Mommy's waist: 37.5", Mommy's weight: 65.3 Kg
	.story SCGS 7.30pm.
	.story #[.elvin] We are back at SCGS for a second time and the seats at their hall still kills my back. These seats are made for a younger and smaller body. At least the content of the talk is interesting. The head of CordLife laboratory is giving a presentation on the science behind cord blood and cord lining banking. He is a total geek through and through. After thirty minutes of scientific jargons, technical procedures, miracle stories, he ended his talk with a video and left the stage. Woa. The marketing department sent him here to "educate" the public and he took it literally. What a guy. But I'm sold on this cord banking technology based on its life-changing properties. It sounds like the elixir of life and I am betting my money on it. For science!

	.story #[.ellis] We are counting down to the arrival of Audrey! The past few weeks were really hectic. Other than the many matters of the new house, Papa and Mummy were busy settling some of Audrey's stuff. The insurance policy insuring Mummy during pregnancy and Audrey at birth has been submitted and is pending approval. We have also enrolled for the Cord Blood and Cord Lining Bank with Cord Life for 21 years after attending a talk.
	.story At the Baby Fair over the weekend, we bought Audrey's diaper, some cute Mittens and Booties, Baby detergent and bottle cleanser and Mummy's nursing bra. We are slowly ticking off the checklist of things to buy and it really feels real now!

	.story Daddy tested the appliances we bought for Audrey such as bottle steriliser, breast pump and mattress to ensure it is usable when Audrey arrives. He secretly lied on the mattress and exclaimed how comfortable it is. Naughty Daddy. Daddy also tested the breast pump by putting it on his flat chest and he was shocked by how painful it was! Mummy, on the other hand, was busy picking the beansprout husks. It was really time consuming and energy draining but it was satisfying to complete bowls of husks. Soon, Daddy will sew the pillow case and we can fill it with the husks. Please wait for the one and only one Audrey's Husk Pillow made with love!

	.story #[.elvin] Audrey makes big wave-like movements now. I think she is dancing. It sure looks there is a party going on in there. After the party over, she sleeps a lot. She would not wake or kick even when I talk to her. Mommy's tummy is a huge bulge now and it doesn't look like it is going to stop anytime soon. We are between four to eight weeks from delivery now. At the doctor's visit, Audrey was in a head down position. With a deft swipe of the scanner, Dr. Tseng found her face and took a snapshot. Audrey was winking and punching her hands to say "Hello"!

	.story On a serious note, raising a child is serious business. We were given an estimation of the hospital: doctor's delivery fee - $3000, hospitalisation - $5000, daily doctor checkup - $300, daily PD checkup - $200. You need to build a small warchest before you start on this Adventure of Parenthood.
	.story Right now, our favourite activity is buying Audrey's clothes. These miniature and adorable clothes tugs at my heart string all the time. They are designed to lure parents into an impulsive frenzy to whip out their wallets and buy! So today, we came back with two more sets of clothes. I heard the stories of children outgrowing their clothes in matter of weeks but we can't help ourselves. Look at those cute mittens hanging up to dry. Soon, I will wear them on Audrey and satisfy my primal urge to create the cutest baby ever.

	.story #[.elvin] For the past few weeks, we were busy preparing Audrey's stuff. The baby cot is set up with the help of Ellis' brother. There is a reshuffling of furnitures in and out of the room for the cot to fit in there. I was definitely glad that we could fit all the things in our small and cozy room. There were plenty of clothes to wash. Both new and hand-me-downs. Grandmother (my mum) bought a cute set of clothes from Mother Care. Now that Audrey has so many clothes, Mommy and I went to buy drawers to store them. Mommy's siblings shared to buy a Combi stroller for Audrey. Even before she arrives, Audrey has so many gifts already. I'm envious.

Keep up the good work and continue to absorb as much nutrients as possible! Mummy is getting more tired with each passing day... But I am looking forward to your arrival!
	.story I managed to record a few instance of Audrey's super active afternoons. It is as if my whole belly shifted as she kicks. I have no choice but to stop my work and feel her. Sometimes I can feel that small little foot of hers sticking out from my belly. Some other times I can feel her punch so close to my groin that I though she is already coming out. It is truly amazing!

	.story Sometimes Daddy disturbs Audrey by placing his head so close to her and tickling her with his chin. And Daddy will get some reactions from her. These are the happy moments that make both Daddy and Mummy smile from ear to ear.
	.story It is the start of a new year. We were busy the past weekend attending gatherings with friends and families. Not sure when I will have the time to meet up with my friends so I think it is a good time to meet up during this festive season. Chinese new year is coming soon, in a month's time! And we are all excited whether Audrey will choose come out in the year of Monkey or Rooster. I shall update when I pop!

	.story #[.elvin] There is hardly enough space in the womb for Audrey these days. She is so much stronger now. That means she gets to choose where to place her cute butt and stretch her legs. There will be large hard lump on the left tummy where her backbone is and a smaller bump on the right where she rest her feets. It's like relaxing on a upside-down hammock as her head is locked downwards. Doesn't she get dizzy from being head down the whole time? She seems to be enjoying it though. There she is, peacefully sleeping in the ultrasound.

		| Heart Rate 140 BPM. Mommy's Weight: 66.8 Kg
	.story #[.elvin] Mommy wants a pillow case for Audrey's husk pillow so here I am making one. First, we drew out the design on paper and then measured the pillow's dimension. Next, Mommy measured 104cm x 22cm on the fabric. I double-checked the measurement and cut it out. As they say, measure twice, cut once. When the fabric is cut, the edges will unravel so I sew a hem. To get to the final shape, I folded the fabric in half with a flap at the opening. The hardest of sewing is the spatial visualisation of how to sew the fabric together inside out. After both edges were sewn down, I flipped the fabric the right side out and tada, we have a pillow case.

Starting from a small dot, the cells multiply rapidly, then slowly, pausing sometimes, then increase in pace again. Growth of a foetus is like making many small sprints on a long journey. The only record of our baby's progress is in the ultrasound snapshots from each doctor's visit. Every minute, we draw closer to the big day where we invite baby to the world and become parents.

	.story #[.ellis] Our gynae confirmed my pregnancy after I missed my period. We were elated. A little baby growing inside me. It is so tiny, only a small black dot. Medical ultrasound is amazing.

	.story #[.ellis] I feel my body going through many changes at once. I become hyper-sensitive to smell, nauseated in front of some food and have higher body temperature. Every morning between to 2 am to 3 am, I have an urgent need to pee. And then I lay sleepily back on bed and now I feel hungry. I close my eyes hoping my weariness will overcome my hunger pangs. Nope, hunger wins so I sit up in the dark and munch through bread and biscuits. Ah, the woes of a pregnant mum.

	.story #[.ellis] I was bleeding and got really worried for little baby. Went to the clinic and I cried when I heard little baby's heartbeat! Thump, thump, thump, thump. This is first time I am hearing the heartbeat. I was ordered to walk less and rest more so I took some days off. Staying at home is boring but keeping baby safe is more important.

		| CRL: 54.56 mm. 
	.story #[.ellis] We rushed from work to the clinic to do a scan. Found out that there was a slight tear that caused the bleeding. The tear was probably from too much walking and exertion. Dr. Liauw advised for a full bed rest in a serious tone. And also no hanky panky.
